<q> Is GIGYF2 an RNA-binding protein?

<na> We then wondered if GIGYF2 directly binds to RNA. This is strongly suggested by mRNA interactome
studies in which direct interactors of polyadenylated RNA are comprehensively identified by mass
spectrometry following UV-mediated crosslinking of proteins to nucleic acids and pulldown on oligo-dT
coupled beads

<a> Indeed, using this unbiased proteomics approach, GIGYF2 was identified as an RBP
in HEK-293 (1), Huh7 (26) and in mES (3) cell lines. However, GIGYF2 was absent from the RBP
dataset obtained from HeLa cells using the same approach (2)

<a> As shown on Figure 3B, a clear and significant enrichment of red fluorescent signal was observed for both Ago2
and GIGYF2 when compared to the control GFP sample, indicating that GIGYF2 is also an RBP in
HeLa cells.

<na> We have recently shown using a novel conditional proteomics approach that GIGYF2 is
associated with a complex that contains both miRISC core components Ago2 and GW182, and
validation by co-immunoprecipitation revealed that the association is stabilized by RNA (7).

<na> By contrast, upon sodium arsenite-induced
cellular stress, GIGYF2 translocates to stress granules (Figure 1B, C) as evidenced by extensive colocalization
with HuR, an RBP that serves as a marker for these cytoplasmic RNA granules (22). As in
certain conditions HuR is reported to also localize to P-bodies (23), another class of cytoplasmic RNA
granules, we also performed co-stainings with an antibody crossreacting with Hedls a marker of Pbody
(24).

<na> RNA extracted from Hela 11ht WT cells and cells overexpressing GIGYF2 from three biological
replicates was sent to the Genomics Core Facility (EMBL, Heidelberg) for Affymetrix GeneChip array
analysis. RNA samples (500ng) were processed and labeled for array hybridization using the Ambion
WT Expression kit (Life Technologies, catalogue number 4411974).

<na> Fluorescence signals from the RNA binding assay were measured using a Spectra Max M5 plate
reader (Molecular Devices), using the following parameters: eGFP: excitation 475 nm, emission 509
nm; WellRED: excitation 650nm, emission 670 nm. The measurements were done from the bottom of
the plate.

<na> For RNA extraction and purification, cells or RNA-IPed material were mixed with TRI or TRI LS
Reagent (Sigma) and purified on affinity columns using the Direct-Zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo) that
includes a DNase-treatment step.

<na> Immunofluorescence was performed using HeLa-11ht cells seeded in a 12 well removable chamber
slide (Ibidi). Cells were fixed with 3.7% Formaldehyde for 10 min at RT followed by three washing
steps with PBS, each 3 min. Permeabilization was performed with 100% ice-cold methanol for 5 min
at RT, followed by three washing steps with PBS, each 3 min.

<na> Hence it is important to identify and
characterize RBPs in order to fully understand how genes are post-transcriptionally regulated.
Argonaute proteins are the core component of the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC)
that uses the small non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) as guides to find mRNA targets through partial
sequence complementarity (5).

<q> Is CE2 a binding site for Hsp70?

<na> Since CE2 affects Hsf1 transactivation but not DNA binding, we hypothesized that it could be a
binding site for Hsp70. To test this, we performed serial immunoprecipitation from whole cell
lysates followed by mass spectrometry (IP/MS) of 3xFLAG/V5-tagged Hsf1 mutants to identify
specific interactions with chaperone proteins.

<na> Finally, to test a direct role for CE2 in binding to Hsp70, we utilized an in vitro binding assay we
previously established to monitor interaction between recombinant purified Hsf1 and Hsp70
(Zheng et al., 2016).

<a> Whereas wild type Hsf1-6xHIS was able to outcompete wild type Hsf1-V5
for binding to the Hsp70 Ssa2 at a 5-fold molar excess, Hsf1∆CE2 257 -6xHIS was not (Figure 4C).
These results demonstrate that CE2 is a direct binding site for Hsp70 through which Hsp70
represses Hsf1.

<na> In this study we tested the assumptions of our mathematical model of the heat shock response
by severing the Hsp70 transcriptional feedback loop and mapping an Hsp70 binding site on
Hsf1. While we uncovered more biological complexity in Hsf1 regulation than we represent in
the model, we validated the model’s central tenets – that Hsp70 binding and dissociation turn
Hsf1 off and on, and that transcriptional induction of Hsp70 represents a critical negative
feedback loop required for the homeostatic regulation of Hsf1.

<a> The two N-terminal segments contribute to hitherto unknown repression of Hsf1 DNA
binding, while the single C-terminal segment, CE2, is a binding site for Hsp70 through which
Hsp70 represses Hsf1 transactivation. Although, as its name suggests, CE2 is conserved, it is
restricted to a subset of yeast species and is absent in mammalian HSF1 sequences.

<na> In addition to mechanistic insight into Hsp70 binding, our results for the first time reveal the
existence of intramolecular determinants that negatively regulate Hsf1 DNA binding.

<na> The dual mechanisms of Hsf1 regulation described here – control of DNA binding and
accessibility of the transactivation domain – in combination with the fine-tuning capacity we
previously demonstrated for phosphorylation (Zheng et al., 2016), exert exquisite quantitative
control over the Hsf1 regulon. We propose that these three regulatory mechanisms enable cells
to precisely tailor an optimal response to a variety of environmental and internal stresses.

<na> We are grateful A. Kane for providing us with the phleomycin resistance cassette and deleting
SSA3, to A. Jaeger for beneficial discussions, and to H. Lodish, G. Fink and their lab members
for insightful comments. Experimentally, we are indebted to E. Spooner and the Whitehead
Proteomics core for mass spectrometric analysis, to the Whitehead Institute FACS facility for
technical assistance and to N. Azubuine and T. Nanchung for a constant supply of plates and
media.>

<a> Next we mapped a discrete Hsp70 binding site on Hsf1 to a motif in the
C-terminal activation domain known as conserved element 2 (CE2).

<na> Removal of CE2 resulted in
increased Hsf1 activity under non-heat shock conditions and delayed deactivation kinetics. In
addition, we uncovered a role for the N-terminal domain of Hsf1 in negatively regulating DNA
binding.

<q> Does something block TPC channels?

<a> Tetrandrine, a bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb
Stephania tetrandra[76], potently blocks TPC channels. NED19 and Tetrandrine both
show promise in treating cancers[18] and filoviral infections[19].

<na> In eukaryotes, two-pore channels (TPC1-3) comprise a family of ion channels
that regulate the conductance of Na+ and Ca2+ 44 ions across cellular membranes. TPC1-3
form endolysosomal channels, but TPC3 can also function in the plasma membrane.

<na> Filoviruses, such as Ebola, exploit TPC-mediated ion release as a means of escape
from the endolysosome during infection. Antagonists that block TPC1/2 channel
conductance abrogate filoviral infections. TPC1/2 form complexes with the mechanistic
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) at the endolysosomal surface that couple
cellular metabolic state and cytosolic nutrient concentrations to the control of membrane
potential and pH.

<na> We determined the X-ray structure of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana
(AtTPC1) to 2.87Å resolution–one of the two first reports of a TPC channel structure.
Here we summarize these findings and the implications that the structure may have for
understanding endolysosomal control mechanisms and their role in human health.

<na> Two-pore channels (TPCs) form a subfamily (TPC1-3) of eukaryotic voltage- and
ligand-gated cation channels[10,11]. TPC1/2 function as part of the ion transport
machinery that regulate the endolysosomal resting membrane potential and pH[12].
TPC1/2 knockout mice have lower cellular amino acid levels and endurance during
fasting[13], suggesting that TPC-mediated control of the endolysosome membrane
potential and pH regulates nutrient transport

<na> Pharmacological block of TPC1/2 by trans-Ned-19 (NED19) and certain calcium
channel blockers inhibits viral infectivity. Antagonists could prevent viral uptake through
effects on membrane fusion, receptor binding, or proteolytic activation.

<a> NED19 acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of NAADP activation by directly blocking mammalian TPC
channels[73].

<na> Approved medications of the dihydropyridine (DHP), phenylalkylamine (PAA),
and benzothiazepine (BTZ) classes of L-type Cav antagonists block Ebola virus
trafficking and fusion in the endolysosome in a TPC1/2 dependent manner[19].

<a> Approved medications of the dihydropyridine (DHP), phenylalkylamine (PAA),
and benzothiazepine (BTZ) classes of L-type Cav antagonists block Ebola virus
trafficking and fusion in the endolysosome in a TPC1/2 dependent manner[19].
These drugs, like Tetrandrine and NED19, presumably act by blocking channel conductance.

<na> The pore asymmetry in TPCs may change
the way these molecules, especially DHPs, link the pore and VSD domains.
Determining the antagonist binding sites on TPCs may serve as a template for the
development of novel therapies for filoviral infections and possibly cancer.

<q> How MukB ATPase is activated?

<a> Taken together, the results show that MukB ATPase is activated
additively and independently by the N-and C-terminal domains of MukF.

<a> Interactions of the MukF N-terminal domain with the MukB neck and MukF Cterminal
domain with the MukB head, activate MukB ATPase independently
and additively in vitro, with the addition of both fragments restoring wild type
MukB ATPase levels.

<na> We show that interaction of the MukF N-terminal domain with the MukB neck did not
compromise MukF dimerization. Therefore, MukF dimerization in headsengaged
MukBEF complexes directs formation of dimers of MukBEF dimers,
thereby explaining the stoichiometry observed in vivo (Badrinarayanan et al.,
2012, Figure 1B right panel).

<na> The MukF N- and C-terminal
domains stimulate ATPase independently and additively, consistent with them
each targeting only one of the two MukB ATPase active sites in the
asymmetric complex.

<na> MukF C-terminal derivatives, FC1 and FC2, interacted
with MukB, and all of its derivatives, as expected, because the MukB ATPase
head participates in this interaction (Figure 2B; Figure 1; Woo et al., 2009).

<na> Addition of FN2 and FC2 together restored ATPase to the
level observed with wild type MukF. FN6, lacking helices 8 and 9 did not
stimulate MukB ATPase, consistent with its failure to interact with the MukB
neck (Figure 4-figure supplement 1D).

<na> The mutagenesis strategy was
informed by MukB and MukF sequence homology and structures of
comparable kleisin and SMC neck interactions with kleisin in cohesin, and
with B. subtilis SMC complexes (Gligoris et al., 2014; Huis in’t Veld et al,
2014, Bürmann et al., 2013). Three triple substitutions in helix 9 of FN2
exhibited an impaired ability to activate MukB ATPase.

<na> In addition, we analyzed MukB variants carrying three double amino
acid substitutions in the neck, located near MukB C-terminal head domain.
They were designed to be on different faces of a putative candidate coiled-coil
helix. MukBm1 (M1215K L1222K, blue trace) had <10% of MukB ATPase,
MukBm3 (L1219K L1226K, yellow trace) had about 35 % activity while
MukBm2 (E1216A E1230A, showed no reduction in ATPase (Figure 5B).

<na> (B) ATPase activity of MukB and MukB variants
mutated at the neck, MukBm1 blue, and MukBm3 yellow, in the presence of MukF.

<na> MukE showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of MukF-activated MukB
ATPase (Figure 6A; Figure 6-figure supplement 1), in agreement with a
report by Bahng et al. (2016), which cited our previously unpublished
observation.

<d> https://doi.org/10.1101/121335

<q> Proteins SecAN interacts with?

<a> This once again supports the conclusion that SecAN
is present in the photo-crosslinked product. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that SecAN
is able to directly interact with the periplasmic region of the BamA protein.

<na> Furthermore, we
demonstrated that SecAN is most likely part of the supercomplex that we revealed
earlier as one which is responsible for the biogenesis of β-barrel OMPs in living
cells and spans the cytoplasm, the inner membrane, the periplasm and the outer
membrane.

<a> Subsequently, we unveiled a shortened version of SecA that we designate as SecAN, which directly interacts with
not only nascent β-barrel OMPs but also the periplasmic region of BamA.

<na> These observations strongly implicate that our
newly revealed SecAN protein, rather than the commonly believed SecYEG, functions
as the translocon for translocating the nascent β-barrel OMPs in living bacterial cells.

<na> This indicates that this shorted version of SecA only contains the
N-terminal region of the full length form of SecA, we thus designate it as SecAN.
In correlation to this, the ~ 80 kD photo-crosslinked product for the OmpF-G18pBpa
variant was also detectable only with antibodies against the N-terminal region (lane
1), not with antibodies against the C-terminal region of SecA (lane 3), as shown in Fig
3C.

<na> Taken together, these results strongly suggest the existence of a shortened version of
SecA, SecAN, which interacts with the nascent β-barrel OMPs, but not nascent
periplasmic proteins, in living cells. Additionally, this SecAN is able to form a
photo-crosslinked dimer (of ~ 65 kD) upon UV irradiation, thus likely exists as
homo-oligomers in living cells.

<na> (B) Immunoblotting results for detecting the shortened version of SecA (SecAN)
after resolving on a high resolution gel, probed with antibodies against the N- (lane 1) or C-terminal (lane 2) region
of SecA.

<na> We subsequently tried to find out whether or not SecAN
is located in the membrane fraction, as to be required for it to function as a protein-conducting channel of
nascent β-barrel OMPs. For this purpose, we first separated the membrane and
soluble fractions of the cell lysates by differential centrifugation, according to a
previously reported protocol (42).

<na> We next tried to purify the SecAN protein from the membrane fraction of E. coli cells
for further characterization, but without much success. We therefore decided to
resolve the membrane fraction by SDS-PAGE, and to directly excise the gel slice
around the ~ 45 kD position, where we identified SecAN
(as in lane 2, Fig. 4), for mass spectrometry analysis.

<na> demonstrated that the nascent polypeptides of periplasmic proteins and β-barrel
OMPs respectively interact with SecY (Fig. 1B) and SecAN (Fig. 3A and 3C). Nevertheless,
we have not yet detected any direct interaction between these nascent
polypeptides and the full length form of SecA in living cells (Figs. 3A, 3C, S1).

<q> What is preferred sequence for ssDNA to be recognized by A3A?

<a> Most interestingly, A3A preferred a pyrimidine at -2 when there
was a purine at +1 position. However, the reverse was not true; purine at -2 position with pyrimidine at +1
position did not result in comparable affinities. In fact, the worst binders (ATCT and GTCT) were those that
contained purines at -2 with pyrimidines at +1 position. Thus, we have identified (T/C)TC(A/G)as the preferred
sequence for ssDNA recognition by A3A.

<a> To determine the structural basis for the A3A consensus sequence (T/C)TC(A/G), crystal structures of
A3A bound to ssDNA recently determined by our group and others (PDB ID: 5KEG and 5SWW) were analyzed.
The target deoxycytidine is well coordinated and buried within the active site of A3A (Figure 4A) in these
structures.

<a> Although A3A has prefers (T/C)TC(A/G), neither of the co-crystal structures has the optimal nucleotide
identity at the -2 and +1 positions. However, in both structures, the base at +1 (pyrimidine T in 5KEG and a
purine G in 5SWW) stacks with the critical histidine 29 (Figure 5A & B) (20, 22).

<na> A common feature between the two A3A–ssDNA complex structures is that the ssDNA forms a “U”
shape in the active site (Figure 5C & D). This U shape of the bound polynucleotide may be conserved among
deaminases, including adenosine deaminases (20, 33). In both A3A-ssDNA structures, the U shape of the
ssDNA orients the -2 and +1 bases in close proximity to each other. Thus, we hypothesized that the observed
sequence preference (Figure 3) for the -2 position is a result of intra-DNA interactions rather than specific
interactions with the protein.

*<na> To determine the potential for intra-DNA interactions when A3A is bound to a (T/C)TC(A/G) signature
sequence, molecular models were developed based on the crystal structures of A3A bound to ssDNA (PDB ID:
5KEG and 5SWW).

<na> The hairpin was based on a previously
identified hairpin sequence from succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B (SDHB) RNA (34). The
affinity for TTC in the loop region of hairpin DNA was higher than that in linear DNA (26 nM vs 90–127 nM
respectively). As expected, A3A had a higher affinity for the DNA hairpin with loop region containing TTC
compared to one with AAA (26 nM vs ~676 nM respectively)

<na> A3A affinity to a target cytidine in the loop region of an RNA hairpin was also tested. The exact SDHB
hairpin RNA sequence including UC in the loop of this hairpin versus a modified SDHB hairpin RNA replacing
the UC with AA was compared. A3A had specific affinity for the hairpin RNA containing UC compared to AA (37
nM vs 202 nM respectively) (Figure 7B).

<a> . In this study
we quantified the ssDNA specificity of A3A, and identified the consensus signature sequence as (T/C)TC(A/G).
The dinucleotide sequence preference for A3A, TC, which was previously found through activity assays (10, 20,
21) was confirmed and expanded to a preference for pyrimidine-TC-purine.

<na> Structural analysis
of the two A3A-ssDNA complexes containing two distinct, but suboptimal ssDNA sequences have led us to
develop a model for the molecular mechanism for A3A’s specificity to ssDNA. In contrast to previous results
(27), which implicate the -2 position as defining specificity, the base at this position observed in both A3A–
ssDNA co-crystal structures do not make any specific interactions with the protein.

*<na> A3A signature sequences, (T/C)TC(A/G), that we identified, not only accounts for the
discrepancies in the A3A target sequences reported in the literature such as TTCA versus CTCG (21) (20), but
also leads us to advocate a new paradigm for identifying A3A’s involvement in mutation of endogenous or
exogenous DNA.

*<q> Are ceramide kinases bad for laboratory strain of yeast?

<a> We document herein that ceramide kinases are toxic for a standard laboratory strain of yeast
(JS1256) and although we presume this toxicity correlates with the accumulation of phosphodihydroceramide
species, this remains to be proven.

<na> The failure of PF-543, SKI-II and ABC294640 to rescue growth might be due to either cytotoxicity or
failure of the compounds to accumulate (penetration - (extrusion + metabolism)) sufficiently in the
yeast cells.

<na> We next asked whether ceramide kinase (CerK) expression effects the growth of S. cerevisiae and, if
so, whether this phenotype could be reversed by adding a CerK inhibitor to the media. To our
knowledge, neither ceramide kinase activity nor the predicted products of the enzyme (dihydroceramide
1-phosphate, phytoceramide 1-phosphate) have been observed in S. cerevisiae.

<na> Further,
mass spectrometry based methods have been described [6], and a kit for detection of the ADP product
are available (e.g. Promega’s ADP-GloÔ Kinase Assay). All of these assays are more expensive
and/or lower throughput relative to the yeast-based assay discussed herein.

<na> Given our need for a higher throughput, inexpensive assay for sphingosine kinases to assess new
chemical entities as potential inhibitors, our attention was drawn to a recent report by Kashem et al. [7]
describing the use of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a platform to screen for human
SphK1 inhibitors.

<na> The sphingolipid kinases (sphingosine kinase (SphK) and ceramide kinase (CerK)) catalyze the transfer
of phosphate from ATP to the primary hydroxyl of dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine), phytosphingosine,
sphingosine, (SphK) or dihdyroceramides, N-acyl phytosphingosines and ceramides (CerK).

<na> We note that a problem
intrinsic to ceramide biochemistry, i.e. the difficulty in manipulating naturally occurring ceramides, which
are water-insoluble, is circumvented with the yeast assay.

<na> Graf C, Klumpp M, Habig M, Rovina P, Billich A, Baumruker T, Oberhauser B, Bornancin F.
Targeting ceramide metabolism with a potent and specific ceramide kinase inhibitor. Molecular
Pharmacology 74, 925-932 (2008) [PMID: 18612076]

<na> This gene is commonly
deleted in S. cerevisiae to decrease extrusion of test compounds. As shown in Fig. 2B, PF-543
restored full growth of the KYA1 strain expressing human SphK1 in a dose dependent manner, albeit
with a EC50 value (5.7 µM) that is about three log orders higher than the reported KI value of this
compound [12]. ABC294640, although also not cytotoxic, failed to rescue growth of KYA1 yeast
expressing HsSphK2 at concentrations up to 100 µM (not shown).

<na> The yeast-based assay is inexpensive and it requires neither specialized equipment nor radioactive
material. Although not rapid (24-48 hours), we have found the assay to be robust, indeed, it yielded
reliable results in the hands of four undergraduate research assistants. We were unable to reproduce
one minor aspect of the Kashem et al. [7] study.

<q> Does Hsp70 contribute to the folding process of luciferase?

<a> This is consistent with Anfinsen’s hypothesis for protein folding. We conclude
that neither Hsp70 nor Hsp90 actively contribute to the folding process of luciferase. Thus, the
Hsp70-Hsp90 cascade lacks foldase activity despite being required to generate high yields of
refolded protein.

<na> Here we propose that the conserved Hsp70 and
Hsp90 chaperonessupport formation of the folding nucleus by providing a gradient of decreasing
hydrophobicity. Early on the folding pathway Hsp70 uses its highly hydrophobic binding pocket
to recover a stalled, unproductive folding intermediate.

<na> Here we describe
that the ubiquitous, ATP-dependent chaperone machines Hsp70 and Hsp90 form a conserved
cascade that promotes spontaneous protein folding by a stop-start mechanism.

<na> Hsp90 acts downstream of Hsp70, but its contribution to protein folding is unclear 7-10. Under
certain conditions Hsp70 can refold proteins in the absence of Hsp90 11. However, molecular
understanding of the Hsp70 folding mechanism requires solving two paradoxes: (i) Hsp70 binds
to short, very hydrophobic stretches, which are required to build the hydrophobic core.

<na> Protein folding activity of Hsp70
chaperones was established both in vivo
and in vitro using luciferase as a
paradigmatic client, nota bene in the
absence of Hsp90.

<na> To address the Hsp70
paradoxes, we first revisited refolding of
luciferase by the E. coli Hsp70 system,
consisting of the Hsp70 DnaK, ATPase
stimulating J-protein, DnaJ, and nucleotide
exchange factor, GrpE.

<na> To address the Hsp70
paradoxes, we first revisited refolding of
luciferase by the E. coli Hsp70 system,
consisting of the Hsp70 DnaK, ATPase
stimulating J-protein, DnaJ, and nucleotide
exchange factor, GrpE.

<na> At low Hsp70
concentration (5 μM), however, Hsp90 was not essential for folding of GR-LBD (Fig. 3e). We
conclude that the mechanistic interplay of Hsp70 and Hsp90 is also valid for folding of a protein
that requires Hsp90 for maturation in the cell.

<na> Together, our data demonstrate that Hsp90 has a conserved, general folding function
downstream of Hsp70. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for earlier observations
that presence of Hsp90 improves efficiency of the Hsp70 machine.

<na> The Hsp70-
Hsp90 cascade acts far ahead of the transition state of the folding reaction of the client protein.
The task of the cascade is repositioning the folding client on the energy hypersurface such that it
can ultimately fold autonomously according to Anfinsen, independent of chaperone action.

<q> Can unbinding of biotin-streptavidin be
described by a reaction-coordinate model?

<a> Several groups over the decades have asked the question:
does unbinding of biotin-streptavidin proceeds
through well-defined ligand exit pathways that can be
described by a reaction-coordinate (RC) model?2,3 For
this system, the experimental evidence is in favor of this
statement, given well-defined exponential statistics for
the ligand residence times.

<a> Here, we explicitly construct
such a RC using the method SGOOP, which allows optimizing
a low-dimensional RC from a dictionary of possible
collective variables or order parameters.

<na> Biotin-streptavidin is a very popular system used to gain insight into protein-ligand interactions. In its
tetrameric form, it is well-known for its extremely long residence times, being one of the strongest known
non-covalent interactions in nature, and is heavily used across the biotechnological industry.

<na> With the new enhanced sampling methods11,12 we study
the biotin-streptavidin system (PDB ID: 3ry2) in its
wild-type (WT) and with an Asparagine-Alanine mutation
(N23A).

<na> Furthermore, we settle a long-standing question about
the cause versus effect nature of two events, namely water
movement into binding pocket and lengthening of a
specific biotin-streptavidin hydrogen bonding interaction
(D128-biotin bond).

<na> Biotin-streptavidin is a classic system used to gain
insight into protein-ligand interactions. It is heavily
used across the biotechnological and nanobiotechnological
industry, and is well-known for its extremely long
biotin residence times.

<a> In
this work, using the recently proposed method “Spectral
gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP)” proposed
by Tiwary and Berne,12 we optimize the reaction
coordinate (RC) for biotin unbinding which quantifies
the relative importance of these two and other molecular
determinants in unbinding.

<na> Note that SGOOP as implemented in this work
through the Maximum Caliber framework, takes into explicit
account the diffusion anisotropy between different
collective variables25 which has been known to have profound
effects on reaction pathways as has been show for
ligand binding and many other problems.

<a> Unbinding dynamics for WT and N23A can be mapped
onto a one-dimensional reaction coordinate

*<a> When viewed as a function of the optimized reaction
coordinate, we find that the free energy landscape Fig. 2
for both the WT and N23A maps into 4 states, namely
bound, unbound and 2 intermediates.

<q> does murine amylin does form amyloid fibers?

<a> Our group have shown for the first time that murine amylin does form low and high order
oligomers and amyloid fibers in vitro (Palmieri et al. 2013b).

<na> On the other hand, some variants such as murine amylin has
been described as non amyloidogenic, either in vitro or in vivo. Recent data have demonstrated
the amyloid propensity of murine amylin and the therapeutic analogue pramlintide, suggesting a
universality for amylin amyloidosis.

<a> The aggregation product from murine amylin was responsive to a specific antibody raised
against amyloid oligomers, the A11 oligomer antibody. Pancreatic islets of swiss mice have also
shown responsivity for the anti-oligomer, indicating the natural abundance of such specimen in
rodents. These data provide for the first time evidences for the toxic nature of oligomeric
assemblies of murine amylin and its existence in non-transgenic mice.

<a> Murine amylin is also prone to amyloid aggregation in vitro [8, 9], which
collectively suggest an universal feature of amylin analogues.

<na> We raised the hypotheses weather it would exist a universal propensity for the oligomeric
assembly and amyloid formation of amylin analogues, whose detection would be hampered both
by ligands such as buffers as observed for murine amylin [9] and pramlintide [7], among other
technical details.

<a> Kinetics of amylin aggregation – We have conducted an amyloid aggregation assay of both
human and murine amylin in phosphate buffer. Both variants show a typical aggregation profile
characterized by a lag phase followed by an exponential increase in ThT fluorescence over time
converging to a plateau (Fig. 1).

<na> Further possible limitation
in amyloid aggregation assays of murine amylin may be due to the use of tris buffer, which
hampers amylin aggregation [7, 9].

<a> For both human and murine amylin, mature fibrils and oligomers were
observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), for both 3 days and 7 days incubation
(Fig. 2). We have found long fibrils mounting twisted fibers, characteristic of amyloid material
[20] in both human and murine amylin (Fig. 2), confirming the existence of amyloid material in
the aggregated samples.

<na> These aggregates were not detectable in both human and murine amylin directly
tested from soluble peptide stock solution in DMSO (not shown). Under TEM we could observe
the specificity of these antibodies, able to recognize small material assembly and no binding to
mature fiber (Fig. 4).

<na> During dot-blot data acquisition, we observed that the signal for both antibodies in
response to murine amylin samples were lower than those used for human amylin, requiring
different instrumental setting to compensate for these features.

<q> What are ancestors of chalcone isomerases?

<a> We inferred three ancestral nodes by maximum-likelihood: The most probable
ancestor of all chalcone isomerases (ancCHI), of all CHI-like proteins (ancCHIL), and
the CHI/CHIL common ancestor (ancCC). Given the wide divergence between CHIs
and FAPs, a very earlier ancestor was not inferred.

<a> Chalcone isomerase (CHI), a key enzyme in plant flavonoid biosynthesis, is
presumed to have evolved from a non-enzymatic ancestor related to the widely-
distributed fatty-acid binding proteins (FAPs) and a plant protein family with no
isomerase activity (CHILs for “CHI-like”). Ancestral inference confirmed that CHI
evolved from a protein lacking isomerase activity.

<na> However, given the evolutionary distance between FAPs and CHIs, and the rarity of
cases where enzymes evolved from non-catalytic proteins, CHI’s ancestor may have
been an isomerase, and activity was subsequently lost in CHILs.

<na> Hence, the
structural alignment was trimmed in loop regions and at the N- and C-termini, and a
phylogenetic tree was generated (Fig. 1b; see Supplementary Fig. 2 for the complete
tree). Remaining gaps and ambiguously aligned positions were handled manually in
the reconstructed ancestors (Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Fig. 3).

<na> The three inferred ancestors expressed in high yield as soluble proteins in E. coli and
displayed high thermal stability (apparent midpoint melting temperatures (Tm) >
75 °C; Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). AncCHI was an active CHI
with a kcat/KM of 2.1 × 105 M-1s-1 for (S)-naringenin formation, ~40-fold lower than that
of Arabidopsis thaliana CHI (AtCHI, 7.7 × 106 M-1
s-1 , Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table
4). Like all characterized extant CHIs, ancCHI enantioselectively produces only (S)-
naringenin (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Table 4).

<na> Therefore, ancCC appears to be correctly
folded and stable, suggesting that the lack of enzymatic activity is not due to inference
errors. However, we only reconstructed the statistically most probable sequence while
in effect, ancestral inference yields a “cloud” of sequences that relate to the historical
ancestor.

<na> Thus, an alternative
trajectory based on F133L is in fact compatible with the phylogenetic trajectory. That
F133L is deleterious in an extant CHI indicates that incompatibility is the outcome of
the later stages of evolution, and also explains why Leu at position 133 is inferred with
negligible probability in CHI’s ancestor.

<na> Our results indicate that CHI evolved from a catalytically inactive ancestor thus
showing that emergence of catalysis and stereospecificity in non-catalytic scaffolds is a
feasible evolutionary scenario. That said, a bacterial CHI22 284 has evolved independently
in an enzymatic protein fold, exemplifying that plant CHI is an exception rather than
the rule.

<na> That the inferred ancestor is devoid of CHI activity is also interesting because
other inferred enzyme ancestors were found to be multi-functional, typically
harboring varying levels of the activities found in the extant protein families that
diverged from them23 295 . Here, we have obtained an ancestor that is not multi-
functional, at least with respect to the isomerase activity.

<na> CHI’s evolution seems unique not only in having its origins in an inactive
ancestor, but also in following a smooth, largely additive trajectory. In fact, we
surmise that these two features, and also the relatively facile spontaneous rate of
chalcone cyclization, are related; namely, it is the absence of strong epistasis and the
pre-existing uncatalyzed cyclization rate that made ancCC a feasible evolutionary
starting point despite its lack of initial activity.

<q> Where is HpiC1 enzyme active site.

<na> We have established the location of the HpiC1 enzyme active site, and using mutational analysis
identified critical residues for catalysis and demonstrated a key relationship between amino acid sequence
and product outcome.

<a> We have established the location of the HpiC1 enzyme active site, and using mutational analysis
identified critical residues for catalysis and demonstrated a key relationship between amino acid sequence
and product outcome. Most importantly, we identified D214 as the source of an active site acid that is
required for catalysis, and is consistent with numerous reports of acid catalyzed Cope rearrangements
(22).

<na> We describe herein the first crystal structure of a Stig cyclase, and show through a mutational analysis
that localizes the active site of HpiC1 (and other members of these unique enzymes) the ability to
reconfigure its metabolite profile. These data combined with computational studies provide compelling
insights into the mechanism of Cope rearrangement, 6-exo-trig cyclization and electrophilic aromatic
substitution for this broad class of natural products.

<na> We next sought to determine the location of the enzyme active site. The high resolution, substrate-free
HpiC1 structure did not immediately suggest a location for substrate binding and catalysis. The first
indication of the enzyme active site location was revealed by abnormal difference density in a pocket
located at the distal end of each subunit between Ca2+ sites 1 and 2.

<na> The initial docking solutions compelled us to further interrogate this region of the protein as the
putative active site. First, we probed the role of HpiC1 D214 toward catalyzing formation of 12H. This
residue is 100% conserved in all of the currently identified Stig cyclases and is exceptional as the amino
acid in the hydrophobic pocket most likely to participate in acid/base chemistry, which can reasonably be
inferred to promote [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangments (22).

conformational changes in the F138 active site residue. These data show that F138 primarily explores two
different conformations along the MD trajectory.

<a> MD simulations show that D214, which is essential for enzyme activity as demonstrated by
mutagenesis experiments described above, stays preferentially in a conformation in which the D214 side
chain is pointing towards the inner cavity of the active site, while F138 acts as a wall on the side of the
active site pocket (Fig. 5a, Fig. S10).

<na> Although the arrangement of the active site pre-organized for catalysis is the
preferred one, an alternative conformation of F138 is sampled during the 500 ns trajectory. In this
alternative conformation, the F138 side chain is displaced towards the center of the active site, and D214
becomes buried and inaccessible for interaction with the substrate, generating an inactive conformation
(Fig. S10-S11).

<na> To further understand how the HpiC1 active site could control the formation of the
hapalindole/fischerindole products, and how select mutations can alter the product distribution, we
performed additional MD simulations with intermediates prior to electrophilic aromatic substitution
bound into the active site of the HpiC1 enzyme and associated mutants.

<na> HpiC1 and FimC5 and their corresponding active site mutants
were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cultures from a single colony were used to
inoculate 1.5 L terrific broth (TB) supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin.

<q> Where ATP binds Kir6.2?

<a> The - phosphate of ATP is coordinated by the main-chain nitrogen of G334 and K185, while
the - and -phosphates are coordinated by side-chain nitrogens of K185 and R50, respectively.
The ribose group is in close contact with the I182 and F333 side chains; the adenine ring stacks
against the aliphatic portion of the R50 side chain as well as Y330, and is H-bonded to the main
chain nitrogen of R50, and main chain carbonyls of I49 and Y330.

<na> Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of the channel bound to a high-affinity
sulfonylurea drug glibenclamide and ATP at 3.8Å resolution, which reveals in unprecedented
details of the ATP and glibenclamide binding sites.

<na> ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are unique hetero-octameric complexes each
composed of four inwardly rectifying Kir6 channel subunits and four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR)
subunits belonging to the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family (Aguilar-Bryan
and Bryan, 1999; Nichols, 2006).

<na> To begin to address the structural mechanisms by which ATP and sulfonylureas such as GBC
inhibit KATP channels to stimulate insulin secretion, we carried out single particle cryo-EM and
determined the structure of the β-cell KATP channel complex in the presence of ATP and GBC
(Martin et al., 2017).

<na> While our initial structure at a resolution of 5.7Å revealed the overall
architecture of the channel and location of the ATP molecule, it was unable to clearly define the GBC
binding site and the atomic details associated with ATP binding.

<na> To obtain a structure of KATP channels bound to GBC and ATP, channels comprising a rat Kir6.2
and FLAG-tagged hamster SUR1 (96 and 95% sequence identity to human sequences,
respectively) were expressed in rat insulinoma INS-1 832/13 cells (Hohmeier et al., 2000), affinity
purified, and imaged in the presence of 1mM ATP (no Mg2+) and 1µM GBC, as described
previously (Martin et al., 2017).

<na> On the cytoplasmic
side, the intracellular loops ICL1, ICL2, and the N-terminal portion of L0, prior to the “lasso
motif,” cluster around the Kir6.2 N-terminus which harbors the slide helix and key ATP-binding
residues and also forms part of an intersubunit β-sheet (Fig.2B).

<na> Non-hydrolytic binding of intracellular ATP to the cytoplasmic domains of Kir6.2 induces rapid
and reversible closure of the pore (Nichols, 2006). We have previously reported the location of
the ATP-binding site at the interface of the cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal domains from two
adjacent subunits (Martin et al., 2017), giving 4 equivalent sites for the Kir6.2 tetramer.

<na> Mutations that disrupt channel function are known to
cause a spectrum of insulin secretion disorders (Ashcroft, 2005; Koster et al., 2005). Specifically,
loss-of-function mutations result in congenital hyperinsulinism, whereas gain-of-function
mutations lead to transient or permanent neonatal diabetes (Ashcroft, 2005). The pivotal role of
KATP channels in insulin secretion regulation makes them an important drug target.

<na> More recently, they have also become the primary pharmacotherapy for
neonatal diabetes patients carrying gain-of-function KATP channel mutations (Aguilar-Bryan and
Bryan, 2008; Ashcroft, 2007; Sagen et al., 2004). Despite their clinical importance and decades of
research, how sulfonylureas interact with and block KATP channel activity remains poorly
understood.

<q> Can Binding of PIP and RNA both bind to 3C?

<a> Binding of PIP and RNA to 3C is mutually exclusive

<a> The addition of PI4P to the 3C-RNA
complex (Figure 3I) led to resonance positions similar to that of the 3C-PI4P complex (Figure 2A),
suggesting that PI4P competed out RNA and that PI4P and RNA binding were mutually exclusive.

<na> Molecular-docking simulations revealed a putative site of PIP binding to poliovirus (PV) 3C protein
that was validated using NMR spectroscopy. The PIP-binding site was located on a highly dynamic
α-helix that also functions in RNA binding.

<na> PIP clustering was
mediated by interaction with residues that interact with the RNA phosphodiester backbone. We
conclude that 3C binding to membranes will be determined by PIP abundance. We suggest that
the duality of function observed for 3C may extend to RNA-binding proteins of other viruses.

<na> Shengjuler et al. show that a viral RNA-binding site can be repurposed
for PIP binding. PIP clustering can be achieved. The nature of the PIP may regulate protein
conformation.

<na> The PIP-binding site
overlaps the well-established RNA-binding site of PV 3C (Amero et al., 2008). We characterized
the PIP-binding specificity of 3C in a soluble system as well as in the context of a lipid bilayer.

<a> Both approaches revealed broad, yet specific, binding to a combination of mono-, bis- or tris-
phosphorylated phosphoinositides. Binding of PV 3C to PIPs and RNA was mutually exclusive.

<na> The major cluster is located near the N-terminal helix, which is
positioned adjacent to a conserved loop implicated in RNA binding (Amero et al., 2008). The
minor cluster is on the opposite side of the N-terminus of 3C (Figure 1A)

<na> t is known that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain, 3D, of enteroviruses binds
to PI4P, although it is not clear where on the protein this binding occurs (Hsu et al., 2010).
Because the 3CD protein accumulates to a much higher level in PV-infected cells than 3D and 3CD
has been implicated in formation and/or function of the genome-replication organelle (Oh et al.,
2009), we used the available structural information for these proteins (Marcotte et al., 2007;
Mosimann et al., 1997; Thompson and Peersen, 2004) to screen for PI4P-binding sites by using a
molecular-docking algorithm (Goodsell et al., 1996; Morris et al., 1998).

<na> MD simulations were consistent with multiple PIPs binding to PV 3C along the shallow cleft used
for RNA binding (Figure 5). While the negative charge of the phospholipid headgroup contributed
to PIP binding, the display of the charge on the inositol ring contributed to high-affinity binding
(Table 1).

<q> Does TGFbeta mutation increase lifespan?

<a> Previously it has been shown that TGFbeta (daf-7) mutation
extends lifespan via insulin signaling and that both daf-2 and daf-7 regulate the transcription of daf-16
dependent genes.

<na> Moreover, we established that there is no synergistic benefit in a daf-2 or daf-7
background, implying the involvement of the TGFbeta and IGF pathways in this synergy.

<na> Based on existing literature, we identified a set of well-characterized and evolutionarily conserved
ageing pathways and lifespan extension mechanisms (Supplementary Table S1).

<na> For each pathway, we identified drugs and drug-like molecules
reported to extend lifespan in at least one common model organism (nematodes, fruit flies or mice).
We were interested in drugs that might eventually be tested in humans so we favored drugs with
reported efficacy in mammals or that are already approved for human use.

<na> Of
the remaining eight combinations, four extended lifespan as much as their best component while the
other four combinations nullified each other and did not result in lifespan extension and none were
toxic (Extended data Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S2)

<na> Lifespan extension resulting from the two synergistic pairs, while larger than those of previously
published drug effects, were still smaller than the benefits seen with genetic mutations9 133 . This raises
the question whether the effect size seen with the synergistic pairs represented the maximum
achievable by adult-onset drug treatment or if further benefits could be gained by adding additional
compounds.

<na> Only the RAP-
based combinations, RAP+RIF and RAP+RIF+ALLAN, showed lifespan extension in daf-2 mutants.
However, the effect size was similar to that of RAP alone and none of the combinations resulted in
further synergy (Fig. 3c, Extended data Fig. 8, Supplementary Table S2).

<na> We also observed an increase in
total sphingomyelin (Fig. 4h); an event that has previously shown to elicit autophagy-dependent
lifespan extension in the nematodes .

<na> Suppression of energy metabolism and inhibition of the electron transport chain (ETC) can extend
lifespan in C. elegans47,48 243 . In our experiments, however, drug treatments did not have inhibitory
effects on basal metabolic rate, instead several of this drugs and drug combinations increased basal
respiration (Fig. 5i), excluding ETC inhibition as explanation for the observed lifespan effects.

<na> These data suggest that there is significant post-
developmental plasticity of lifespan that can be exploited using adult-onset pharmacological
interventions.

<q> How estrogen affects the rates of proliferation and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1 cells.

<a> We found that estrogen increases the rates of proliferation and apoptosis in MC3T3-E1
cells. We used CCK-8 and TUNEL assays to investigate the proliferation and apoptosis of
MC3T3-E1 cells after E2 treatment. We found no significant differences in the groups treated
with low concentrations of E2 after three days.

<a> However, high concentrations of E2 promoted
the proliferation and apoptosis of MC3T3-E1 cells. E2-mediated increases in the proliferation
of MC3T3-E1 cells have been reported in previous studies[22, 23], but we also found a slight
but statistically significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in our high concentration
group, which indicated that treatment with E2 for three days was slightly toxic to MC3T3-E1
cells.

<na> MC3T3-E1 is a clonal pre-osteoblastic cell line derived from newborn mouse calvaria, which
is commonly used in osteoblast studies. To investigate the effects of estrogen on osteoblasts,
we treated MC3T3-E1 cells with various concentrations of estrogen and assessed their
proliferation.

<na> MC3T3-E1 cells are a clonal pre-osteoblastic cell line derived from newborn mouse
calvarias, which is utilized in many osteoblast studies [14]. To investigate the effects of
estrogen on osteoblasts, we treated MC3T3-E1 cells with various concentrations of estrogen
(17-β estradiol, E2), then monitored their proliferation and apoptosis; we then conducted RNA
deep sequencing to investigate estrogen target genes.

<na> Thus, we conclude that estrogen affects bone through negative regulation of
Tgfbr1 and Bmpr1a in MC3T3-E1 cells. Our research provides new view insight into the
mechanisms of action of estrogen on osteoblasts.

<na> The clonal murine pre-osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was used in this study. The cells were
thawed from frozen stocks and cultured in 100-mm culture dishes in α-MEM supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% (w/v) antibiotics/antimycotics (the stock
solution contained 100 U/mL penicillin G sodium, 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25
µg/mL amphotericin B, in saline), 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM nonessential amino
acids, and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Gibco) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% (v/v) CO2.

<na> For the treatment of MC3T3-E1 with E2, the
cells were seeded in each well of a 24- or 6-well plate with 0.5 or 2mL of culture medium.
The cells were incubated in the presence of E2 at different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, and
10nM), and each concentration of E2 was maintained for three days. A group that received
DMSO served as the control.

<na> For the ER and ERβ antagonist experiments, the ER antagonist MPP and the ERβ
antagonist PTHPP were added to the MC3T3-E1 cultures. After 72 h of treatment with the
antagonists, the cells were harvested to quantify the target gene expression.

<na> We found that MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation was unchanged in the low
concentration E2-treated groups (0.01 and 0.1 nM E2) compared with that in the DMSO
control groups (Fig. 1). However, in the high concentration E2 groups (1 and 10nM E2),
MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation was significantly higher than in the DMSO control groups (Fig.
1). These data revealed that high concentrations of E2 promote MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation.

<na> E2, a synthetic, exogenous estrogen that is functionally similar to endogenous estrogen, is
commonly used to study the function of estrogen. MC3T3-E1 cells are a newborn mouse
calvarias cell line, which is commonly used in the study of osteoblasts.

<q> Which region is responsible for strict selectivity of Yoda1 towards mPiezo1?

*<a> Our data show that the strict selectivity of Yoda1 towards mPiezo1 originates from a
minimal protein region spanning residues 1961 to 2063. This region contains 17 residues that are
not conserved between the two mammalian Piezo isoforms and that are dispersed into three
clusters (Supplementary Fig 1)

<na> Hence, understanding how Yoda1 selectively
binds and activates Piezo1 is a key step to rationally design new small molecule modulators with
high selectivity.

<na> Although Piezo2 shares more than 65% of its primary amino acid
sequence with Piezo1, Yoda1 possesses strict Piezo1 selectivity with no measurable modulatory
effects on Piezo2 activity. The activation of Piezo1 by Yoda1 originates from the binding of
Yoda1 to one or more unknown binding site(s) on the Piezo1 channel(26).

<na> The strict Piezo1-selectivity exhibited by Yoda1 must then originate from
amino acid differences between the Piezo1 and Piezo2 primary sequence. Since chimeras
between evolutionary-distant Piezo homologs remain functional(27), we reasoned that chimeras
between mouse Piezo1 (mPiezo1) and mouse Piezo2 (mPiezo2) will yield functioning proteins
with altered Yoda1-sensitivity.

*<na> Hence, we envisage two hypotheses to explain the origin of Yoda1 isoform-
selectivity. First, Yoda1 may directly interact with Piezo1-specific residues. In this case, Yoda1
must directly interact with some of the identified residues in each cluster in the region 1961-
2063. Second, Yoda1 may directly interact with residues that are conserved in Piezo1 and Piezo2
but whose conformation depends on the presence of non-conserved residues in each cluster in the
1961-2063 region.

<na> All chimeras displayed robust responses similar
to mPiezo1. These responses were significantly larger than the response obtained from cells
transfected with a control vector (Fig 1f).

<na> Wide-field fluorescence live-cell imaging
showing GCaMP6m time course upon Yoda1 application in the presence or absence of mPiezo1
can be seen in Video1 and Video2, respectively. The fluorescence of GCaMP6m does not change
upon Yoda1 application in absence of mPiezo1, as when using Fluo8-AM (Fig 1d).

<na> Yet,
none of them completely suppressed the fluorescence response as seen in cells transfected with
mPiezo2 or with the internal chimera 1961-2063. The internal chimera 1961-2063 remains able
to elicit robust fluorescence responses upon acute hypotonic chock (Fig 2c) and to produce
mechano-dependent ionic currents with amplitude similar to wild type mPiezo1 (Fig 2d).

<na> The fits yielded P0 = 32.29 ± 0.93 mmHg for WT
mPiezo1, consistent with previous studies(26). However, the chimera Ch1961-2063 exhibits an
increased threshold for mechanosensitivity with a fitted P0 value of 56.43 ± 0.76 mmHg (see
Supplementary Table 1).

<na> The presence of the entire mPiezo1 1961-2063 region appears necessary for chemical activation
with Yoda1. Interestingly, this region is strategically located at the interface between the pore
and the blade in each subunit (Fig 1a and Fig 2f).

<q> Do RING domains of VPS18 and VPS41 RING form a complex?

<a> Having demonstrated that the RING domains of VPS18 and VPS41 RING form a direct, stable
heterodimeric complex in vitro, we sought to probe the relevance of this interaction for HOPS
assembly in human cells.

<na> A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify potential interaction partners of the
human VPS18 and VPS41 RING domains and the VPS39 zinc finger domain (supplementary
figure 1 and supplementary data).

<na> We thus hypothesised that, rather than binding to other
cellular factors, the VPS18 and VPS41 RING domains may instead mediate intra-molecular
interactions within the HOPS complex.

<na> Affinity capture
(pulldown) experiments were performed by incubating the cell-free expression lysates with
GST-tagged VPS18 RING or VPS41 RING domains immobilised on glutathione resin (figure
2A). These experiments showed that the VPS18 RING construct interacted exclusively with
full length VPS41, and that VPS41 RING interacted exclusively with full length VPS18.

<a> This experiment showed that the RING domain of VPS18 is necessary and sufficient for
binding to the VPS41 RING domain in vitro (figure 2C). Accordingly, we proceeded to directly
assess the interaction between purified VPS18 and VPS41 RING domains.

<a> Reciprocal GST pulldown experiments using all purified recombinant components showed that
VPS18 and VPS41 RING domains form a direct interaction (figure 3A). His-tagged VPS18
RING was purified by Ni2+ immobilisation affinity chromatography followed by SEC, while tagfree
VPS41 RING was purified by removal of the GST tag from GST-VPS41 RING using
human rhinovirus 3C protease and subsequent glutathione capture then SEC.

<na> When various VPS41 constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells, the results were in
agreement with those of the pulldown experiments: the VPS41 RING domain (residues 778–
854) is sufficient and necessary to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous VPS18, and does so
with an efficiency equivalent to that of full length VPS41 (figure 4B).

<na> It was able to coimmunoprecipitate
endogenous VPS18 and VPS11 from these cells, albeit with considerably
lower efficiency than VPS41 RING (figure 5E). This is in line with the previous finding that
yeast Vps8 requires only its C terminus (broadly defined as Vps8 residue 450 (in the α-
solenoid) to the end) to be recruited to CORVET (45).

<na> Our finding that the VPS18 and VPS41 RING domains mediate HOPS assembly is in broad
agreement with a previous study in which co-transfected, epitope-tagged HOPS subunits were
co-immunoprecipitated by truncated forms of VPS18 (containing the RING domain) and
VPS41 (containing α-solenoid and RING) (11).

<na> The RING-H2 domain of VPS18 contains an extended space between the sixth
and seventh zinc ligands (65 amino acid residues, rather than the typical maximum of 48 (35,
41)), while otherwise maintaining the characteristic spacing of the zinc ligands.

<q> How much time one needs to converge the heat capacity difference between two conformational states in MD simulation?

<a> A
statistical thermodynamic analysis of a 1 ms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor indicated that 10s of μs of simulation may be needed to
converge the heat capacity difference between two conformational states.

<a> A total of 5 μs of MD simulation was run for KSI and MalL in both the substrate-bound and
proxy TS representations over ten replicate simulations for each state (Supplementary
Results).

<a> Here, we experimentally determine the value for ∆𝐶𝑃
from the temperature dependence of the
rate in the absence of enzyme denaturation for two quite different enzymes: the small, dimeric
ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) and the large, monomeric α-glucosidase MalL (Fig. 1). In
parallel, we employ extensive MD simulations (10 μs per enzyme) to obtain heat capacity
differences between two states along the reaction pathway.

<na> 50-500ns MD simulations for KSI (A) and MalL (B). Thin lines are individual runs, thick
lines are the average of 10 runs. Insets show overlay of histograms for both states, and the
structures indicate the species simulated (RS – reactant state; IS – intermediate state; TSA –
transition state analogue).

<na> MD simulation and analysis. All simulations and analyses were performed using the Amber
package and the ff99SB-ILDN protein force field. For KSI, PDB entry 1OHP was used with
Asn38 mutated back to the wild-type Asp and either the substrate or intermediate of the KSI
reaction (Fig. 2A) modelled in chain A (based on the co-crystallised inhibitor 5α-estran-3,17-
dione); chain B was left empty.

<na> The ‘window’ for the moving average was varied between 5-80 ns and calculated
∆𝐶𝑃 values converge when the window size is between 40-80 ns (Figure 2f, Supplementary
Table 3).

<na> Convergence
with moving average window size of ∆𝐶𝑃
values calculated for MalL, with value determined
from experiment indicated by dotted line (with grey area indicating standard deviation).

<na> Heat capacity differences for enzyme catalyzed reactions can be calculated from ∆〈𝜕𝐻2
〉 (eq. (1)). To measure ∆〈𝜕𝐻2〉 from simulation, there are two main challenges: a) the amount of
sampling required for the system to define the enthalpy variance, and b) an accurate and
consistent representation of the reactant state (Michaelis complex) and the transition state.

<na> However, calculating variances for each
luster (as for KSI) does not take into account that frequent switches between the distinct
conformational states will also contribute to the variance. In addition, several clusters are
dominated by one state only (Supplementary Fig. 8).

<na> Heat capacity changes are emerging as essential for explaining the temperature dependence of
enzyme-catalysed reaction rates. This has important implications for enzyme kinetics,
thermoadaptation and evolution, but the physical basis of these heat capacity changes is
unknown.

<q> Do RNAs require 5’ cap to interact with eIF4E?

<a> Although the interaction of most RNAs with eIF4E requires the 5’ cap, some RNA sequences can bind
eIF4E in a cap-independent manner (41,42).

<na> The sensitivity of 5’ TOP
mRNA translation to eIF4F inhibition and eIF4E overexpression suggests that the nucleotides proximal to
the 5’ cap may play a role in the recruitment of eIF4E to mRNAs.

<na> How eIF4E binding and translation are influenced by additional nucleotides downstream of the +1
position is even less clear. Subsequent cap-proximal nucleotides can decrease the binding of eIF4E
relative to the 5’ cap alone, if those nucleotides induce secondary structure in the RNA near the 5’ end
that physically blocks eIF4E binding (28).

<na> The T7 RNA polymerase consensus sequence
encodes guanosines at positions +1, +2, and +3 from the 5’ cap (40), which would severely restrict the
variability of the juxtacap nucleotides in the library of motifs (Supplementary Figure 1A).

<na> To control for cap-independent and background binding, we
measured binding at the highest eIF4E concentration (1.25 μM) in the presence of 7-methyl-GTP,
(me7GTP), a competitive inhibitor of eIF4E binding to the 5’ cap, or GTP, which does not compete with the
cap for binding to eIF4E. As expected, me7GTP addition blocked most RNA binding to eIF4E (data not
shown), suggesting predominantly cap-dependent binding.

<na> The first possibility is that eIF4E directly
interacts with nucleotides downstream of the 5’ cap, and that the juxtacap nucleotide sequence directly
dictates the extent of eIF4E interaction; in this case, the effect of a juxtacap nucleotide sequence would
be maintained across all mRNAs containing that juxtacap nucleotide sequence and translated in a capdependent
fashion, regardless of the 5’UTR context.

<na> However, it has remained unknown whether the
difference of a few nucleotides adjacent to the 5’ cap can influence translation. Our findings suggest that
the juxtacap sequence can influence the accessibility of the 5’ end of an mRNA, and that small changes
in this sequence can modulate translation.

<na> Binding of an
eIF4G fragment that associates with eIF4E but does not contain the RNA binding domains of eIF4G can
alter the structure of eIF4E and increase its affinity for the 5’ cap (47,48).

<na> The nucleotide adjacent to the cap, corresponding to the first transcribed nucleotide, can directly
contact eIF4E (25), and reduces the affinity of the 5’ cap for eIF4E in biochemical assays (26,51). In
mammals, the ribose of the +1 nucleotide is typically methylated at the 2’ position, and often the +2
nucleotide is methylated as well (52,53).

<na> Nucleotides in the +1 position can form different contacts
with eIF4E and alter the affinity of eIF4E for the 5’ cap, depending on the nucleotide identity (25,51), and
we predict that differences in the +1 nucleotide will alter the juxtacap sequence preferences of eIF4E.

<q> Is expressed ATF4 translocated to the nucleus?

<a> Additionally, expressed ATF4 was
translocated to the nucleus suggestive of
transcriptional activation (Fig. 4c).

<na> Activating
Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4). Enhanced ATF4
protein expression correlated with increased
levels of downstream target genes including
CHOP and GADD34 and was associated with
amplification of eIF2alpha de-phosphorylation and
translational de-repression under stress.

<na> Central to the regulation of the ISR
is the transcription factor, ATF4. ATF4
promotes the transcription of many target genes
including those involved in nutrient uptake and
metabolism, protein folding, and cell survival as
well as other transcription factors that further
regulate a broad array of biological processes
(15-19).

<na> Furthermore, we demonstrate that IRF5
promotes mRNA translation of ATF4 during
amino acid deprivation resulting in enhanced
expression of ATF4 target genes, protein
synthesis, and altered ISR gene signature.

<na> Therefore, we hypothesized that
IRF5-dependent protein synthesis observed in
Fig. 3 and Fig. S4 may be the result of ATF4
mRNA translation.

<a> Consistent
with up-regulation and nuclear localization of
ATF4, we observed increased expression of the
ATF4-dependent target genes, GADD34 and
CHOP, in IRF5(+) MEFs (Fig. 4a)

*<a> Unlike ATF4 expressed in
MEFs, we did not observe increased IRF5
nuclear translocation following culture in EBSS
(Fig. 4c).

<na> These
results suggest that IRF5 does not up-regulate
ATF4 at the transcriptional level. To further
explore this effect and determine whether IRF5
may regulate ATF4 expression at the level of
mRNA translation, we pre-treated IRF5(-) and
IRF5(+) MEFs in culture media for 1 hour with
either an RNA synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin
D; ActD), a protein synthesis inhibitor
(cycloheximide; CHX), or DMSO (negative
control) and then cultured cells for 30 minutes or
1 hour in EBSS containing fresh inhibitor.

<na> Consistent with
ATF4 regulation at the level of mRNA
translation and the lack of IRF5 nuclear
translocation, ATF4 protein synthesis in both
IRF5(-) and IRF5(+) MEFs was unaffected by
ActD treatment.

<na> The data
demonstrate that IRF5 enhances expression of
ISR-related genes following amino acid
deprivation, and unlike previous reports of
transcriptional control by IRF5, we determined
that increased ATF4 up-regulation was at the
level of mRNA translation (Fig. 5).

<q> Which original plasmid was used for coaD knockout?

<na> We created E. coli
ΔcoaD cells with a heat curable rescue plasmid containing constitutively expressed wild-type
coaD (Supp. Fig. 6A, C, D). This rescue plasmid showed escape frequencies lower than 1 in
20,000 under heat selection in pooled assays (Supp. Fig. 6E).

<a> As PPAT (coaD) is an essential gene, we re-engineered plasmid pTKRED28
and to constitutively
express bicistronic wild-type (WT) coaD gene followed by sfGFP (Supp. Fig. 6A). The WT coaD
gene from E. coli MG1655 was amplified with a strong constitutive promoter
(TTGACGGCTAGCTCAGTCCTAGGTACAGTGCTAGC) and RBS
(TACGAGTGAAAGAGGAGAAATACTAG) on the 5’ end, and BamHI site on the 3’ end.

<na> The pTKcoaD plasmid expresses PPAT and GFP constitutively while the
λ-red recombinase genes are under IPTG induction. The temperature sensitive origin of
replication can be used to heat cure the plasmid at 42ºC, which can be confirmed through the
loss of GFP fluorescence (Supp Fig. 6E).

<na> Knock out strains were verified by Sanger sequencing and
colony PCR (Supp. Fig. 6C, 6D). We further verified that heat curing of the rescue plasmid
suppressed cell growth and characterized the escape frequency.

<na> The plasmid used to express PPAT orthologs is a derivative of high-copy pUC19 with a
pLac-UV5 promoter, NdeI and KpnI restriction sites for cloning, an in-frame stop codon, and a
20-mer random assembly barcode.

<na> We also deduce from the lack of GFP positive colonies in
the plates at various steps in the dilution that these adaptive mutations did not occur in cells still
harbouring the rescue plasmid. A total of 18 barcodes from serial dilution replicate A and 16
barcodes from replicate B were removed from further analysis.

<na> . As a positive control we also amplified the wild-type E. coli coaD gene from
the pTKcoaD rescue plasmid. The designed primers flanked each construct, with reverse
primers annealing to each gene-specific barcode.

<na> We created E. coli
ΔcoaD cells with a heat curable rescue plasmid containing constitutively expressed wild-type
coaD (Supp. Fig. 6A, C, D). This rescue plasmid showed escape frequencies lower than 1 in
20,000 under heat selection in pooled assays (Supp. Fig. 6E).

<na> Knockout of the coaD gene in E. coli was carried out using standard techniques28,31
. Briefly pTKcoaD was transformed into both E. coli DH10B electrocompetent cells (ThermoFisher
Scientific). Individual colonies were chosen and made electrocompetent. These were

<na> Following successful dialout PCR and re-cloning, we transformed 1 ng of each construct in
pEVBC into 7 uL of electrocompetent coaD knockout cells. We analyzed the presence of growth
by counting dilution Carb + Kan plates at both 30°C and 42°C (Supp. Table 3, Supp. Fig. 10A).

<q> Is ATPase activity of TePif1 affected by ssDNA?

<a> Like most helicases, the ATPase activity
of TePif1 was greatly stimulated by the presence
of ssDNA (Fig. 2B, k1/2(ATP) = 2.96 ± 0.13 nM).

<a> By
including ssDNA substrates of various lengths, we
also found that the stimulation of TePif1 ATPase
activity was length dependent, with a maximal
stimulation of ~6-fold in the presence of ≥ 20 nt
poly(dT) ssDNA (Fig. 2C).

<a> However, ssDNA as
short as 5 nt was still able to stimulate ATPase
activity ~2.7-fold, which is consistent with S.
cerevisiae Pif1 being able to bind to very short
lengths of ssDNA (25).

<a> In contrast to ssDNA,
dsDNA did not significantly stimulate TePif1
ATPase activity (Fig. 2B).

<na> As is
typical of helicases from thermophilic organisms,
recombinant TePif1 was amenable to overexpression
and purification, thermostable in vitro,
and displayed activities similar to its better-studied
eukaryotic homologs.

<na> Mutational
analysis indicated that the WYL domain of TePif1
inhibits ATPase activity but stimulates helicase
activity.

<na> These data suggest that TePif1
could be a suitable enzyme for use in helicasedependent
amplification (HDA) or other
isothermal molecular biology applications.

<na> To ensure that the observed ATP
hydrolysis was due to TePif1 and not a
contaminating enzyme from E. coli, we also
generated a Walker B box mutant of TePif1
(TePif1-DENQ) by mutating the acidic D106 and
E107 residues to their uncharged amide
counterparts (D106N, E107Q) (Fig. 1B).

<na> To
examine the types of DNA substrates that TePif1
might preferentially act on, we assayed for DNA
binding and unwinding of a series of simple
substrates in vitro.

<na> We next assessed in vitro helicase activity.
Based on the poor binding to blunt dsDNA (Fig.
3A), it was unsurprising that TePif1 displayed no
significant unwinding of this substrate (Fig. 4A).

<q> How easy to find conformational global minima for monosaccharides?

<a> The free energy of the monosaccharides can differ by
few kcal/mol simply due to slight differences in the orientation of the hydroxyl groups, leading to
increased or decreased intramolecular hydrogen bonding network, hence identification of true global
minima for even simple monosaccharides is a non-trivial task.

<na> Even simple monosaccharides represent a challenging group of molecules for computational chemists
due to their vast number of available conformations caused by the presence of five hydroxyl groups
(for hexoses) and multitude of puckering configurations, and this is further complicated by the
addition of adduct ions (i.e. Li+, Na+ , Ca2+) that can coordinate in a number of ways with the
carbohydrate.

<na> Any
charge scheme should be sensitive to the chemical environment each atom experiences, in the case
of lithiated monosaccharides the position of lithium should play a crucial role in the partial charge
assignment.

<na> Average partial charges from Merz-Kollman and Hu-LuYang
charge schemes are shown in Figure S2a and S2b, respectively, whilst CHelpG charges are shown
in Figure S3a. In the case of α-/β-Glc monosaccharides, the molecular conformation was found to have
significant impact on the partial charge distribution resulting in large variations on most atomic types.

<na> We demonstrate that in the case of simple monosaccharides, theoretical CCSs are heavily dependent
on the selection of the charge scheme, basis set and in some cases the functional. The variation based
on chosen charge scheme and basis set in the partial charge distribution on structurally identical ions
can lead to as much as 3-8 % change in the calculated CCS.

<na> The minimal basis set (STO-
3G, blue) led to broadly different partial charges for carbon hydrogens (H1-H62; HC
), hydroxyl oxygens (O1-O4, O6; OOH) and hydrogens (OH1-OH6; HOH), ring oxygen (OCOC)
and lithium adduct in comparison to the other basis sets.

<na> Again, neglecting the minimal STO-3G basis set, the remaining basis set and functional
combinations resulted in practically identical partial charges.

<na> The minimal basis set STO-3G is inadequate for partial charge calculations, routinely resulting in
drastically different partial charges for majority of the atomic types whereas larger basis sets, including
the 3-21G were found to give smaller partial charge fluctuations.

<na> Here, we
use lithiated α- and β-glucose ions as exemplar molecules to detect the effect conformational modification and
changes to the partial charge distribution have on computed collision cross sections. Six popular charge schemes
(Mulliken, APT, CHelpG, MK, HLY and NPA) were examined in combination with three functionals (Hartree-Fock,
B3LYP and M05) and five basis sets (STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, 6-31+G and 6-31G*) on twenty unique structures.

<na> Our findings indicate that molecular conformation makes a significant contribution to fluctuations of partial
charges in Electrostatic Potential (ESP) and Mulliken charge scheme; Partial charges derived using Natural
Population Analysis (NPA) and ESP methods are largely independent of functional and basis set selection; and
both selection of the charge scheme and functional/basis set combination play a large role in the resultant CCS,
often causing few percent fluctuations in the computed values.

<q> How UIS affects Uba5 when added?

<a> The finding that the UIS stimulates Uba5 activity when added in trans suggested structural
changes in Ufm1 may be occurring, despite crystallographic and NMR studies of Ufm1 bound to
Uba5 or the UIS not showing significant changes in structure.

<na> The crystal structure
of UFM1 and its E1 (Uba5) in complex shows that Ufm1 binds to the adenylation domain of UBA5
and interacts with a separate Ufm1-interacting sequence (UIS) in the C-terminus of UBA5.

<na> We found that the residues in the adenylation interaction site of Ufm1 have less
movement when the UIS peptide was bound to Ufm1 and formed a structure that aligns well with
Ufm1 bound to the Uba5 adenylation domain.

<na> Mutation of this amino acid decreases charging
activity and shifts the Ufm1 conformation population toward the unlocked configuration even in
the presence of the UIS peptide. These data suggest a role for the Uba5 UIS in stimulating
activation of Ufm1.

<na> In the “trans-binding” mechanism, Ufm1 interacts with both subunits of the Uba5
dimer: one interaction with the adenylation domain of one Uba5 subunit and one with the Ufm1-
interacting sequence (UIS) within the C-terminus of the other Uba5 subunit.

<a> The interaction between Uba5 and Ufm1 is well described structurally however the
necessity for the interaction with the UIS, beyond additional affinity, for the enzyme is unclear.
Uba5 lacking the UIS cannot be activated, even at high concentrations of Ufm1, despite the larger
interaction with the adenylation domain suggesting an additional role or roles.

<na> Biochemical analysis of Ufm1 mutants identified a site within the
core of Ufm1 that connects the UIS binding site to the adenylation domain binding site within
Ufm1. Ultimately, we conclude that the binding of the Uba5 UIS to Ufm1 stabilizes an adenylation
domain-binding competent version of Ufm1.

<na> For charging assays of Uba557-329 with the UIS peptide, Uba5 (57-329) at 20 μM
concentration was incubated with different concentrations of the UIS peptide
(IIHEDNEWGIELV), or 1mM of the scrambled peptide (ILDIWHEIGNEEV) at 30°C for 90 min
in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP.

<a> The results of
this experiment show that the UIS peptide influences Uba5 activity in an additional way to serving
as a binding domain within Uba5.

<na> These data match our RMSF data showing less motion in the
bound simulations and indicating that the UIS induces Ufm1 to form a more rigid structure.

<q> How LcαE7 catalyzes the hydrolysis of fatty acid substrates?

<a> LcαE7 catalyzes the hydrolysis of fatty acid substrates via the canonical serine hydrolase
mechanism. Boronic acids are known to form reversible covalent adducts to the catalytic
serine of serine hydrolases, which mimic the geometry of the transition state for
carboxylester hydrolysis and therefore bind with high affinity.

<na> We used DOCKovalent, an
algorithm for screening covalent inhibitors, to screen a library of 23,000 boronic acids
against the crystal structure of LcαE7 (PDB code 4FNG).

<na> The potency of the boronic acids was determined by enzymatic assays of recombinant
LcαE7 with the model carboxylester substrate 4-nitrophenol butyrate. All five boronic acids
exhibited Ki values lower than 12 nM (Table 1), with the most potent compound (3)
exhibiting a Ki value of 250 pM.

<na> None of the five compounds showed significant
inhibition of AChE when tested up to their solubility limits (Table 1), with the most potent
compound 3 displaying >106 fold selectivity for LcαE7 over AChE.

<na> We solved the co-crystal structures of compounds 1 to 5 with LcαE7 to assess the binding
poses predicted by DOCKovalent (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3). Difference electron
density maps show the boronic acid compounds covalently bound to the catalytic serine
(Fig. 2).

<na> Thus, compounds that
inhibit WT LcαE7 as well as this common resistance associated Gly137Asp variant would
increase the efficacy of OPs by targeting both detoxification routes.

<na> We tested 12 analogues of 3-bromo
phenylboronic acid with the 3,5-disubstitution pattern of compound 3 (Fig. 3) and determined
their Ki values for WT and Gly137Asp LcαE7 (Table 2).

<na> The
Gly137Asp mutation is located in the oxyanion hole and positions a new general base in the
active site to catalyze dephosphorylation of the catalytic serine15,29. Thus, compounds that
inhibit WT LcαE7 as well as this common resistance associated Gly137Asp variant would
increase the efficacy of OPs by targeting both detoxification routes.

<na> Here, we implemented a virtual screen of 23,000 boronic acid compounds to identify
inhibitors of LcαE7. The 100% hit rate from the initial screen, with all compounds exhibiting
Ki values lower than 12 nM, is surprisingly high, even when compared to previous covalent
virtual screens that exhibited high hit rates against diverse enzyme targets.

<na> An added benefit of boronic acid
synergists is the potential protection from the evolution of resistance. Since boronic acids
are transition state analogues for the phosphorylation of the catalytic serine by OP
insecticides, mutations that hinder boronic acid binding will also likely disrupt OP
sequestration and/or hydrolysis.

<q> Does DddY share cupin motifs with other Ddd families?

<a> Having collected a range of DddY sequences, we could identify common sequence motifs,
including the cupin motifs that are shared by DddQ, DddL, DddK and DddW. These
cupin motifs could also be identified in DddY.

<na> As expected, the two remaining
bacterial ddd+ families, dddD and dddP, and the algal Alma DMSP lyases, do not share
these motifs as they belong to completely different superfamilies.

<na> The first shared cupin motif comprises 4 entirely conserved residues – HxHxxxxExY
(His268, His270, Glu274 and Tyr277 (numbering is for DaDddY). The second motif includes
a third entirely conserved histidine, His342. Of the 5 cupin ddd+ families, structures are
available for DddQ (PDB 4LA2, Ref.19; 5JSO and 5JSP, Ref.20; 4B29 and 5CU1), and DddK
(PDB 5TG0, Ref.26).

<na> Together, these two motifs, and foremost, the above-mentioned 6 active-site
residues (Figure 2A), define the Cupin-DLL superfamily. Further analysis of this
superfamily’s gene content beyond the 5 Ddd+ families is provided in the last section of
the Results.

<a> DddY also shares two
sequence motifs with other bacterial lyases assigned as cupin-like enzymes, DddQ, DddL,
DddK, and DddW. These cupin motif residues are essential for DddY activity, as for the
other cupin DMSP lyases, and all these enzymes are characterized by a common metalchelator
inhibitor (TPEN).

<na> The second His of the 1st motif and its
Tyr (His270 and Tyr277 in DaDddY) are also within the active-site and in close proximity
to the metal ion (< 4 Å, His125 and Tyr131 in PDB 4LA2; His141 and Tyr147 5CU1; His 150
and Tyr156 in PDB 4B29).

<na> Other conserved residues are part of both motifs. For example,
a Trp/Tyr at the end of the 2nd motif is also an active-site residue, with the Trp ring’s NH
placed ~4.5Å from the metal ion (Trp363 in DaDddY; Trp178 in DddQ, PDB 4LA2; Trp195
in PDB 5CU1; Trp204 in PDB 4B29).

<na> These residues of the two cupin motifs are therefore essential for enzymatic
activity, foremost, for the ligation of the active-site metal ion.27 However, Tyr277 that
belongs to the first motif presents a puzzle.

<na> DddY shows the
highest activity among all reported bacterial lyases yet is poorly characterized. Here, we
describe the characterization of recombinant DddY is from different marine bacteria.

<na> However, the specific activity levels, genomic
context analysis, and systematic profiling of substrate selectivity as described in the
accompanying paper, indicate that for only some of these families, most distinctly DddY
and DddL, DMSP lyase is the primary, native activity. In other families, foremost DddQ,
DMSP lyase seems to be merely a promiscuous activity.

<q> Does Vancomycin bind vesicle derived from biological sample?

<a> According to the fitting result of ITC data,
vancomycin also bound to the bacterial derived vesicle (Figure 2.A), but with much
higher affinity (sub-millimolar) than that of liposome (Figure 2.B).

<a> Apparently,
vancomycin binds to the bacterial membrane derived vesicle with higher affinity.

<na> Moreover, the binding affinity increases along with the increment of liposome size. Of
three major lipid components, phosphatidylglycerol is the preferential target for
vancomycin binding.

<a> We also showed that vancomycin associates with vesicle derived
from Staphylococcus aureus membrane in a similar manner as the binding to
liposome. Our data suggested that vancomycin associates with bacterial membrane
through direct interaction with lipid head groups with the extent of the association
depending very much on specific type of lipids and curvature of local membrane
structure.

<na> Herein, we
studied the binding property of vancomycin to artificial and bacterial membranes using
a variety of biophysics methods with the aim to obtain a better understanding of the
binding process for expanding its antibiotic repository.

<na> Vancomycin and nafcillin were from Sigma. Lysozyme and
RNaseA were purchased from Merck. Staphylococcus aureus was from ATCC (strain
#43300) and cultured in tryptic soy broth medium (Becton, Dickinson and Company).

<na> We first utilized liposome as
membrane mimic to explore if vancomycin associates with the cell membrane at all.
We performed isothermal calorimetry experiment by titrating antibiotics into liposome
extruded through polycarbonate membrane (0.1 µm diameter).

<na> Titration of vancomycin into liposome. Raw data and fitting curve of ITC
experiment (left); comparative fitting plot of naficillin and vancomycin titration with
liposome (right).

<na> To explore binding preference of vancomycin among
lipids, we performed ITC measurement of the antibiotic with liposomes prepared from
individual lipid. Based on the Ka value derived from data fitting, binding affinity of
vancomycin to POPG is significantly higher than that to POPEand CL(Figure 4).

<na> Based on the Ka value derived from data fitting, binding affinity of
vancomycin to POPG is significantly higher than that to POPEand CL(Figure 4). Thus,
we established that POPG is the major contributor to the association of vancomycin
with liposome.

<q> How to confirm to confirm computationally extracted splicing events?

<a> In order to confirm the existence of the computationally extracted splicing events, we performed
lariatPCR on cDNA after RNA extraction from human cells and reverse transcription using random
primers.

<na> Therefore regulation of alternative splicing is crucial and yet, due to the
complexity of the human genome (23.000 genes, most of which can be alternatively spliced) diverse
and multileveled. Identifying and understanding the scope and variety of splicing events is still an
ongoing process.

<na> This in part confirms recent findings on recursive splicing events in humans and other vertebrates
and further uncovers an additional level of transcriptome regulation based on a yet undiscovered
level of flexibility and regulation of splice site selection and its impact on gene expression.

<na> And as
shown in D. melanogaster, intron length cannot be the only requirement to induce recursive splicing
cascades10, making space for regulatory potential of these splicing events.

<na> Lariats arising
from recursive or intrasplicing events are, presumably as most lariats, turned over by debranching
with Dbr1 and exonucleolytic degradation of the intron RNA within minutes after splicing

<na> A promising approach in this direction is
targeted RNA-seq with extremely high coverage and subsequent analysis by SplicePie17 that allows to
draw a wealth of conclusions about splicing sequentiality, unusual splicing events and intron dwell
times.

<na> In this work, we performed an in depth analysis of existing RNA-sequencing datasets of human cells
using detailed bioinformatic analyses to identify unusual splicing events in a genome wide manner.

<na> o achieve this, we established a novel extraction pipeline, designed to extract
transient splicing events with high confidence. This approach utilizes reads from RNA sequencing
datasets that cover both, linear splice junctions and circular branchpoint junctions (Figure 2).

<na> Using this approach we identified 97,338 splicing events (neglecting alternative branchpoints), most
of which span full introns. 5,693 events are shorter than the respective annotated intron and
therefore may originate from recursive or nested splicing.

<na> The distribution of all splicing events identified over these four classes is depicted in Figure 3B and C.
These numbers do not take into account alternative branchpoints, but show only those events with
distinct 5’ and 3’ splice sites.

<q> Can miR-144-3p overexpression in
Donor lung fibroblasts
downregulate RXFP1 protein
levels.

<a> Next, we determined if RXFP1
protein levels can be inhibited in a dosedependent
manner in donor fibroblasts
using a range of mimic concentrations (0,
0.1nM, 1nM, 5nM and 10 nM). Western blot
and densitometry analysis show that miR-
144-3p mimic decreased RXFP1 with
increasing concentrations of miR-144-3p
mimic while completely inhibiting expression
of RXFP1 at a concentration of 10 nM in
donor lung fibroblasts (Fig 2F).

<na> We found
that miR-144-3p was upregulated in IPF
fibroblasts compared to donor lung
fibroblast controls

<a> s. Forced miR-144-3p
mimic expression reduced RXFP1 mRNA
and protein levels and increased expression
of the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth
muscle actin (a-SMA) in donor lung
fibroblasts.

<na> Thus, miR-144-3p is highly
expressed in IPF fibroblasts and acts as a
negative regulator of RXFP1 protein
expression.

<na> Targetscan 7.0 online databases, we
identified a putative miR-144-3p targeting
site in the 3’UTR of human RXFP1 mRNA
(Fig 1A). While miR-144-3p is highly
conserved in primates and lower vertebrates,
the RXFP1 target site for miR-144-3p is
conserved only among human, chimpanzee,
rhesus, bovine and rat genomes.

<na> First we determined the levels of
miR-144-3p in IPF and donor lung
fibroblasts using quantitative RT-PCR with
and without TGFb stimulation.

<na> —Next, we determined
whether miR-144-3p overexpression in
Donor and IPF lung fibroblasts can
downregulate RXFP1 mRNA and protein
levels.

<na> These data support the notion that
miR-144-3p regulates RXFP1 expression.
For specificity of the effect of miR-144-3p on
expression of RXFP1, we determined the
effect on other relaxin receptor genes
RXFP2 and RXFP3.

<na> Expression of human RXFP1 orthologue
RXFP2 was unaffected by miR-144-3p
overexpression compared to control mimic
based on qRT-PCR data.

<na> We previously found that the loss of
RXFP1 is also associated with increased
expression of the myofibroblast
differentiation marker, a-SMA.

<q> What MS Western combines in it?

<a> Effectively, MS Western merges the three established analytical approaches: GeLC-MS/MS (30, 31,
34-36); proteotypic peptides clubbed with “top N peptides” protein quantification (31, 37-42) and
QconCAT synthesis of isotopically labelled protein chimeras comprising concatenated sequences of
proteotypic peptides (14, 15, 32).

<na> We termed this method as MS Western to underscore that it is
targeted (rather than global), quantitative, relies on SDS PAGE of crude protein extracts and in this
way is in line with classical Western.

<na> Taken together, a vastly simplified MS Western workflow offers several experimental
advantages. Firstly, both CP and target proteins are independently quantified in the same experiment
by several (usually, three to six) proteotypic peptides and it is expected that they should produce
quantitatively consistent determinations (31, 40).

<na> To quantify a protein by MS Western we first selected a few (typically, three to six)
proteotypic peptides (37, 39) in preliminary GeLC-MS/MS experiments, which also verified the
position of bands of target proteins at the electrophoresis lanes separating crude protein extracts.
However, peptides could be also picked from collections of LC-MS/MS spectra (43, 44) or predicted
by software (45, 46).

<na> This, however, requires highly purified CPs and is prone to batch-to-batch variations and interlaboratory
inconsistency. Instead, MS Western utilizes a simple workaround solution that requires no
CP purification (Fig. 2).

<na> Although the concept of MS Western looked appealing, a major question remained if in-gel codigestion
of relatively pure CPs, of target protein(s) embedded into a polyacrylamide gel matrix
together with abundant background and of pure BSA standard delivered the same yield of proteotypic
peptides?

<na> Three aliquots containing different amounts of human H4 were subjected to SDS
PAGE and quantified by MS Western. Relative abundances of light peptides from BSA and histone
H4 and corresponding heavy peptides from CP02 were in a good agreement (Fig.3A and 3B,
respectively).

<na> We benchmarked MS Western protocol in three ways. First, we checked if its linear dynamic range
was affected by a concomitant protein background. Second, we tested if both WB and MS Western
produced quantitatively concordant determinations of endogenous proteins in whole cell lysates.

<na> Finally, we benchmarked MS Western sensitivity and dynamic range against currently the most
advanced quantitative Western blotting system LI-COR Odyssey (further termed as Odyssey) that
relies upon near-infrared immunofluorescent readout of the abundance of antibodies recognizing the
target proteins.

<na> Next we tested if WB on LI-COR Odyssey and MS Western would provide concordant
quantification of endogenous proteins in whole cell lysates. In contrast to MS Western, pure protein
standards are required for the absolute quantification by the Odyssey because slopes of calibration
plots relying on integral intensities of visualized bands differ between individual proteins.

<q> Does buffering agent treatment increased daily milk yield and lactose content in
lactating goats?

<a> We quantified the daily milk yield and lactose content in the milk of the two
experimental groups from 1 to 19 weeks of treatment. During week 1 to week 2,
there was no significant difference in average daily milk yield and lactose content
between BG goats and HG goats. However, the average daily milk yield (P < 0.05)
and lactose content (P < 0.01) increased significantly in the BG group from 3-19
weeks of treatment compared to the HG group (Fig. 1).

<na> Dairy goats are often fed a high-concentrate (HC) diet to meet lactation demands;
however, long-term concentrate feeding is unhealthy and decreases milk yield and
lactose content. Therefore, we tested whether a buffering agent increases the output of
glucose in the liver and influences of lactose synthesis.

<na> Cumulatively,
the buffering agent treatment increased blood concentrations of glucose via the
gluconeogenes and promoting their synthesis in the liver.

<na> Buffering agent could enhance the acid base buffer capacity and has been used to
prevent ruminant rumen SARA and improve the production performance. Previous
studies indicated that the addition of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), magnesium
oxide (MgO) to a diet could be given to lactating cows to increase the content of
lactose, as well as milk yield[12].

<na> Furthermore, little is known regarding the
mechanism of how a buffering agent improves milk yield and lactose content in goats.
In this study, we created a buffering agent consisting of (0.2% NaHCO3, 0.1% MgO)
and mixed it with a high-concentrate diet source that was fed to lactating goats.

<na> Taken together, these results
suggested that treatment with the buffering agent promoted the gluconeogenesis in the
liver. The level of GHR expression in the liver was significantly up-regulated in BG
goats compared to HG (P < 0.05, Fig. 5).

<a> However, after feeding 19 weeks, the buffering agent added to
the high-concentrate diet stabilized ruminal pH and prevented the occurrence of
SARA. Meanwhile, a increase in the milk yield and lactose content was observed in
the BG group.

<na> Therefore, we
hypothesized that the buffering agent added to the high-concentrate diet reduced the
release of the rumen LPS and stabilized the body health of lactating goats.

<na> Our results indicated that
the buffering agent added to the high-concentrate diet significantly decreased the total
VFA, propionate and butyrate levels in the ruminal fluid. However, the ratio of
propionate to butyrate was increased in the BG group.

<na> It is possible that the buffering agent added to the HC diet inhibited the release
of inflammatory cytokine and stabilized the mammary gland health of lactating goats.

<q> Is CARF domain of Csm6 an oligoA sensor?

<a> This result implies that the
Csm6 CARF domain functions as the allosteric sensor of oligoA ligands and suggests that
effector binding at the CARF domain dimer interface is transduced to the ribonuclease active
site at the dimeric interface of the HEPN domains.

<na> Based on the proposed function of CARF domains in binding nucleotide ligands13,
we hypothesized that the CARF domain functions as the allosteric sensor of oligoA. To test
this, we engineered a glutamine-to-alanine substitution in the conserved CARF domain motif
Ser112–Gln116 in EiCsm6 (Extended Data Fig. 4a), which maps to the dimeric CARF
domain interface in TtCsm6 and would correspond to the ligand-binding face in a canonical
Rossmann fold domain (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

<na> Upon target RNA binding by the
type III interference complex, the Cas10 subunit converts ATP into a cyclic oligoadenylate
product, which allosterically activates Csm6 by binding to its CARF domain.

<na> Given the dimeric architecture of Csm6 and the fact that the CARF domain is a
variant of the Rossmann fold, which is typically found in nucleotide-binding proteins13, we
hypothesized that the ribonuclease activity of Csm6 might be allosterically regulated by a twofold
symmetric nucleotide ligand.

<na> In light of our TtCsm6 data, these results
also imply that other type III systems might generate cyclic tetranucleotides instead.
Consistent with this possibility, a recent structure of the CARF domain protein Csx3 bound to
a linear tetranucleotide shows that the ligand adopts a pseudocircular conformation.

<na> Here we show that Csm6 proteins are allosterically activated by cyclic oligoA effectors
through binding to the CARF domain and that the effector is synthesized by the Palm domain
of the Cas10 subunit of the type III interference complex in response to target RNA
recognition.

<na> Notably, CARF domain ribonucleases of the
Csm6 and Csx1 families are only associated with type III CRISPR-Cas systems containing a
Cas10 subunit with a catalytically competent Palm domain. This hints that the second
messenger-mediated activation mechanism is nearly universally conserved in type III-A and
III-B CRISPR-Cas systems.

<na> The CRISPR-associated protein Csm6
additionally contributes to interference by functioning as a standalone ribonuclease that
degrades invader RNA transcripts, but the mechanism linking invader sensing to Csm6
activity is not understood.

<na> Members of the Csm6 or the related Csx1 protein families are frequently encoded
within type III CRISPR-Cas systems13. These proteins are characterized by the presence of
an N-terminal CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold (CARF) domain and a C-terminal Higher
Eukaryotes and Prokaryotes Nucleotide-binding (HEPN) RNase domain.

<na> We previously showed that Csm6 is a homodimeric RNase that contains a conserved active
site at the dimer interface of the HEPN domains17. Our structural studies further revealed that
Csm6 contains a conserved, positively charged cleft at the dimeric interface of the CARF
domains.

<q> How many stages sirtuin catalytic cycle requires?

<a> The sirtuin catalytic cycle (Fig. 1) is believed to proceed in two consecutive stages [4]. The initial stage
(ADP-ribosylation) involves the cleavage of the nicotinamide moiety of NAD+
and the nucleophilic attack of the acyl-Lys side chain of the protein substrate to form a positively charged O-alkylimidate
intermediate [4, 24].

<na> Sirtuin enzymes are NAD+
-dependent protein deacylases that play a central role in the regulation of
healthspan and lifespan in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals. There is intense interest in the
activation of the seven mammalian sirtuins (SIRT1-7) in order to extend mammalian healthspan and
lifespan.

<na> Based on the conserved mechanism of sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation reactions, we
establish biophysical properties of small molecule modulators that can in principle result in enzyme
activation for diverse sirtuins and substrates.

<na> Recently, in order to extend mammalian healthspan and lifespan, intense interest has developed in the
activation of the seven mammalian sirtuin enzymes (SIRT1-7). Prior work on sirtuin activation has relied
exclusively on experimental screening, with an emphasis on allosteric activation of the SIRT1 enzyme.

<na> Nearly all known sirtuin activators allosterically target SIRT1 and bind outside of the active site to an
allosteric domain in SIRT1 that is not shared by SIRT2-7 [10]. Moreover, allosteric activators only work
with a limited set of SIRT1 substrates [11,12].

<na> Foundations for the rational design of mechanism-based sirtuin activators have been lacking, partly due to
the absence of a clear understanding of the kinetics of sirtuin-catalyzed deacylation. Several types of
mechanism-based sirtuin inhibitors have been reported recently in the literature, including Ex-527 and
Sir-Real2 [16, 17].

<na> Small molecules that can activate sirtuins through modes of action other than the reduction of substrate Kd
are of particular interest, because sirtuin activity often declines during aging for reasons other than
substrate depletion. In the so-called “NAD+ world” picture of global metabolic regulation, the
intracellular concentrations of the sirtuin cofactor NAD+, which can decrease with age, play a central role
in regulating mammalian metabolism and health through sirtuin-dependent pathways [18].

<na> None of these modes of activation are based on the unique catalytic reaction mechanisms of the target
enzymes. Here, we report a general mode of sirtuin activation that is distinct from the known modes of
enzyme activation.

<na> The remaining steps in the catalytic cycle are significantly faster than the above steps. The other
chemistry steps in stage 2 of the reaction are effectively irreversible [27], as is product release in
the presence of saturating peptide concentrations.

<na> Because of the physiological benefits of improving catalytic efficiency under NAD depletion rather than
peptide depletion conditions, we assume saturating peptide conditions in our kinetic modeling in this
paper. However, precisely analogous equations could be derived for saturating NAD, in the event that
activation under peptide depletion conditions is desired.

<q> Do we heat proteins prior to electrophoresis?

<a> Protein samples are typically heated to
facilitate their denaturation prior to
electrophoresis, but formaldehyde crosslinks are
also reversible by heat so we analyzed protein
extracts on gels with and without heating.

<na> Heating did reduce an indistinct smear of
protein toward the top of the lanes of unheated
samples, consistent with heat improving
denaturation of the samples.

<a> Based on the results in Figs. 4B and C, a
brief heating step was used prior to loading
samples on the gels in order to accurately estimate
the relative amount of soluble TF without
reversing any crosslinks that had formed.

<na> This heating step was left out for
unheated samples. Coomassie staining or
membrane transfer was performed following
electrophoresis.

<na> The solution was gently heated on a hot plate to
help the glycine dissolve. The pH of the resulting
solution was then adjusted to 5 using a few
milliliters of concentrated HCl (Fisher).

<na> Importantly, comparison of
CLK and competition ChIP data for TATAbinding
protein (TBP) to a few specific loci shows
that the time scales for chromatin interaction are
similar as judged by the two methods, with
residence times for promoter binding being in
general on the order of several minutes (23).

<na> TFIIE was significantly depleted by
about ten minutes (Fig. 5A, E), but the protein
levels were not detectably changed through seven
minutes of formaldehyde incubation (Fig. 10A).

<na> Experiments measuring formaldehyde
reactivity with amino acids and proteins have
shown that formaldehyde adducts tend to be
mainly formed with cysteine, lysine, and
tryptophan side chains as well as the N-terminal
group of polypeptide chains (42, 43).

<na> Both chromatin and WCE
protein levels were quantified with Bradford
protein dye (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin
as the standard. 8% or 10% denaturing protein gels
were used to resolve 15 µg protein for each
sample.

<a> Unless otherwise noted, before loading the
gel, samples were incubated at 95°C for five
minutes. This heating step was left out for
unheated samples.

<q> What was the model system for diffraction?

<a> As a model system for evaluating the
effects of crystal thickness on diffraction intensities, we use a segment from the β2-⍺2
loop of human prion protein (hPrP) that contains a glycine residue at its amino terminus
(sequence GSNQNNF), hereafter referred to as hPrP-β2⍺2, for MicroED structure
analysis from crystals that vary in thickness.

<na> Reflections were recorded to a resolution of 1.8 Å in both cases yielding 97%
completeness for the 500nm crystal and 79.7% completeness for the 1 µm thick crystal.
Data were reduced in XDS (20) and phased by molecular replacement using the atomic
coordinates of PDBID 5i9s as a search model (21).

<na> The correlation coefficient
between the solved model and the individual crystals is shown in Figure-2D as CCmodel
(Figure 3; SI Table 1).

<na> Proteinase K crystals were collected at a dose rate of 0.01 e- Å -1 sec-1 with an
overall total dose per crystal of less than 3 e- Å-2. hPrP-β2⍺2 samples maintained acamera length of 0.730 m equivalent
to a sample–detector distance of 1.313 m in a
corresponding lens less system. Proteinase K data were collected at a camera length of
1.2m, corresponding to a detector distance of 2.200m.

<na> Theoretical calculations suggest that crystals exceeding 100 nm thickness are excluded
by dynamical scattering from successful structure determination using microcrystal
electron diffraction (MicroED).

<na> Crystals are continuously and unidirectionally rotated in
the beam while diffraction images are collected as a movie on a fast detector (7). A
number of previously unknown as well as known structures have been determined by
this method to atomic resolution (8).

<na> In fact, precession electron diffraction can
avoid many of the artifacts associated with dynamical scattering from near perfect
crystals of inorganic material by pivoting of the electron beam around the crystal (13).

<na> Even 1.5 μm-thick
crystals of lysozyme were shown to produce diffraction that when integrated produced
reasonable statistics (2). Moreover, recent structures determined by ab initio methods to
1Å resolution further indicate that the diffraction intensities obtained by continuous
rotation MicroED are accurate and maintain the relationship between amplitude and
phase (4, 15).

<na> The appearance of resolvable
hydrogens in electron diffraction was first reported for proteins by Rodriguez et al. (15)
and later by Palatinus (19) for small molecules. Our ab initio solutions from thin and
thick crystals are very similar, with a backbone RMSD of 0.07 Å and an all-atom RMSD
of 0.09 Å (Figure 1).

<na> Diffraction was measured from 19 crystals of hPrP-β2⍺2 with thicknesses ranging from
~100 nm to ~1100 nm over similarly-sized wedges of reciprocal space corresponding to
a real-space angular range of approximately -30o to +30o (SI Table 1).

<q> What is secondary structure of t-Darpp?

<a> t-Darpp exhibits 12% alpha helix, 29% beta
strand, 24% beta turn and 35% random coil structures. t-Darpp binds to calcium, but not to other
metals commonly found in biological systems.

<na> The T39 site, critical for t-Darpp activation of the
AKT signaling pathway, is a substrate for phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)
and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5).

<na> t-Darpp (truncated isoform of Dopamine- and cAMP-Regulated Phosphoprotein) is expressed
in adult brain striatal cells and in many types of cancers including those of breast, colon,
esophageal, gastric and prostrate origin [1-5].

<na> To assess the oligomerization properties of t-Darpp, recombinant
human t-Darpp protein was analyzed by blue native gel electrophoresis. In this procedure,
proteins were not treated with denaturing and reducing agents. Figure 1A shows that the majority
of t-Darpp (calculated mass 19.4 kDa based on sequence) runs slightly smaller than the 20 kDa
marker, as expected.

<na> It has been reported that t-Darpp has some positive growth effects, likely by activating the
PKA and/or the AKT pathways [1, 8]. One study has shown that its longer isoform, Darpp-32,
has some growth inhibitory effects [8]. To explore the possibility that t-Darpp may inhibit
Darpp-32 activity through direct protein-protein interaction they were tested for heterooligomeric
complex formation.

<na> Quantification of band intensities
indicates that only about 3% of the Darpp-32 can form a cross-linked homo-oligomer or a
hetero-oligomer with t-Darpp. No detection of t-Darpp homo-oligomers was observed, largely in
agreement with blue native gel analysis.

<na> t-Darpp oligomerization was analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium [17]. In sedimentation
equilibrium, t-Darpp is centrifuged in an analytical ultracentrifuge at a sufficient velocity to
move the protein toward the outside of the rotor, yet not high enough to form a pellet.

<a> Table 1 shows that t-Darpp contains 12%
alpha helix, 29% beta strand, 24% beta turn and 35% random coil at ambient temperature. To
assess whether the protein structure is sensitive to mild heat, the temperature of the t-Darpp
solution was increased from ambient to 50°C for 5 min and allowed to cool slowly back to the
ambient temperature.

<a> Re-measurement of the heat-treated t-Darpp indicated that the protein
secondary structure was not significantly altered: 12% alpha helix, 31% beta strand, 24% beta
turn, and 34% random coil.

<na> The data indicates that the Nterminal
36 amino acids of Darpp-32 significantly alter the secondary structure composition of
the protein by increasing the alpha helical content by 6%, increasing the beta turn content by 6%,
decreasing the random coil by 6%, and decreasing the beta strand character by 6%.

*<q> Is accuracy of the TAR ensemble important determinant of
the docking predictions?

<a> TAR is known to retain a high degree of conformational flexibility when bound to small molecules25–27,
qualitatively, we observe good agreement between the NMR and the EBVS-predicted bound TAR
conformations (Fig. 3a). We find more variability in the ligand placement for docking than for NMR
structures, but in general, docking correctly places molecules near the bulge-expanded major groove
(Fig. 3a).

<na> This analysis could not be performed for neomycin B, for which there are also
available RDCs, because docking predicted more than one small molecule bound conformation,
which complicates analysis of the RDCs (see Methods). The docking predicted structures satisfy the
RDCs to a comparable degree as do the high-resolution NMR structures of the TAR complexes (Fig.
3b and Supplementary Table 3).

<na> We used this dataset, along with 240 known hit molecules, to
evaluate virtual screening (VS) against a high-resolution TAR ensemble determined by combining
NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Ensemble-based VS (EBVS) scores
molecules with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.87 with
~50% of all hits falling within the top 2% of scored molecules, and also correctly predicts the different
TAR inter-helical structures when bound to six molecules.

<na> Dynamic ensembles that capture the flexibility of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures hold
great promise in advancing RNA-targeted drug discovery. Here, we experimentally screened the
transactivation response element (TAR) RNA from human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1)
against ~100,000 small molecules.

<na> Compared to the previous TAR ensemble used in VS9,13 (see E1 below), this improved
ensemble was determined using four rather than two sets of RDCs, obtained using a variableelongation
approach. In addition, a longer MD simulation (8.2 µs versus 80 ns) was used to
generate the pool of starting TAR conformations.

<na> Next, we asked whether the accuracy of the TAR ensemble was an important determinant of
the docking predictions. We repeated EBVS using four additional (E1-E4) twenty-member TAR
ensembles that have variable levels of accuracy as evaluated based on their ability to predict the four
NMR RDC datasets14 (Fig. 2a).

<a> Finally, we
show a direct correlation between the accuracy of the unbound TAR ensemble and the quality of
docking predictions. This suggests that structure-based targeting of flexible biomolecules is possible
with accurate ensemble representations, motivating the continued development of experimentally
determined dynamic ensembles and methods of evaluating their accuracies.

<na> The quality of the various TAR ensembles used in this study was determined by evaluating
how well they agree with four sets of RDC data measured on variably elongated TAR RNA molecules
as described previously. Briefly, the program PALES.

<a> The prediction accuracy decreased
significantly with decreasing accuracy of the target ensemble or when docking against a single RNA
structure. These results demonstrate that experimentally determined ensembles can significantly
enrich libraries with structure-specific RNA binders as well as motivate the continued development of
methods for improving ensemble accuracy.

<na> While many RNA targets fold into unique 3D
structures, application of structure-based approaches such as computational docking to identify
compounds that specifically bind to these structures has been hampered by the high flexibility of RNA
and its propensity to undergo large changes upon binding to small molecules that are difficult, if not
impossible, to model computationally.

<q> Has Delphilin a functional tail?

<a> . In addition, barbed end binding was unaffected; mDelFC
and mDelFCΔ20 inhibited seeded elongation to the same extent (Figure 5F). Thus, Delphilin does
not have a tail that contributes to actin nucleation or end binding.

<na> PDZ domains are common to PSD proteins and, logically, the Delphilin-PDZ domain
binds directly to the C-terminal tail of GluRδ2 (Miyagi et al., 2002). The Delphilin tail, where the
DAD domain would be, is essentially absent.

<na> The tails of several formins, including mDia1, mDia2, Bni1, Bnr1, FRL, and Capu, are important
for nucleation and processivity in addition to autoinhibition (Gould et al., 2011; Vizcarra et al.,
2011; Heimsath and Higgs, 2012). Tail lengths vary a great deal among mammalian formins
(Figure 5A).

<na> To further investigate the Delphilin tail, or lack thereof, we
compared mDelFC to constructs lacking 5 to 25 residues. mDelFCΔ25 was insoluble but the rest
of the constructs were readily purified with the same protocol (Figure S1A). We first assessed the
impact of the truncations by measuring thermal stability of the proteins.

<a> As described above, Delphilin lacks a tail, which is the typical site of the
DAD domain. Despite this, we asked whether Delphilin can be autoinhibited. To do so, we purified
the N-terminal half of α-Delphilin (α-mDelNT).

<a> Given Delphilin’s unusual FH1 domain
and lack of a tail, its FH2 domain could be an interesting base around which to further investigate
how FH1 and tail domains enhance actin assembly.

*<a> Unlike, all other characterized formins, Delphilin does not appear to be autoinhibited. The absence
of an appreciable tail-domain C-terminal to the FH2 domain eliminates the possibility of canonical
DID/DAD autoinhibition (Li and Higgs, 2005; Goode and Eck, 2007). However, an intramolecular
interaction involving the FH2 domain could also inhibit actin assembly. We detected no evidence
of such an interaction.

<na> They vary in their N-terminal halves but not their
C-terminal halves, meaning that none has a C-terminal “tail”. The α variant is the shortest
transcript and can be palmitoylated at Cys-3 (Matsuda et al., 2006).

<na> mDelFC point
mutations, I718A and K868A, as well as the mDelFC tail truncations were introduced by
QuikChange Site Directed Mutagenesis (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA). hDelFFC (aa: 744-1211;
NP_01138590) was assembled from synthetic DNA, which was codon optimized for E. coli
expression (IDT), and cloned into pET-15b+.

<q> Do Hfq homologs remain soluble at low temperatures?

<a> In terms of solution behavior, experience has shown that Hfq homologs generally remain soluble in aqueous
buffers at temperatures >70 °C, and that they resist chemical denaturation (e.g., treatment with 6 M
GndCl); in many cases, depending on the species of origin, Hfq samples are insoluble at low temperatures.

<na> Initial purification of Hfq can be achieved by using a heat-cut to precipitate endogenous, mesophilic
E. coli proteins. Proceed by incubating the supernatant from the last step (i.e., clarified
lysate) at ≈ 70–80 °C for ≈ 10–15 min (see Note 2); a substantial amount of white precipitate
should develop within minutes. Next, use a high-speed centrifugation step (e.g., 33000g for 30
min) to clarify the soluble, Hfq-containing supernatant; for pilot studies, the supernatant and
pellet fractions from this step can be saved in case SDS-PAGE analysis becomes necessary.

<na> This should be the simplest, most minimalistic buffer in which the biomolecule is stable and soluble
(at a concentration of at least 1-2 mg/mL). Because RNA is involved, inclusion of salts of divalent
cations, such as MgCl2, may be found to aid in crystallization and overall diffraction quality.

<na> Like other Sm proteins, Hfq assembles into toroidal discs that bind RNAs with varying affinities
and degrees of sequence specificity. By simultaneously binding to a regulatory small RNA (sRNA)
and an mRNA target, Hfq hexamers facilitate productive RNA∙∙∙RNA interactions; the generic nature of
this chaperone-like functionality makes Hfq a hub in many sRNA-based regulatory networks.

<na> Hfq functions broadly as a chaperone, facilitating
contacts between small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) and their cognate mRNAs [3]. The RNA interactions
may either stimulate or inhibit expression, depending on the identity of the mRNA–sRNA pair and the
molecular nature of the interaction (high or low affinity, stable or transient, etc.) [4,5].

<na> In that Hfq•RNA complex, comprised of E. coli Hfq bound to the Salmonella
RydC sRNA (Fig 1A), the 3ʹ-end of the sRNA encircles the pore, towards the proximal face of the
hexamer, while an internal U–U dinucleotide binds in one of the six lateral pockets on the periphery of
the Hfq ring (Fig 1B).

<na> As an example
of judiciously choosing (and/or designing) an RNA system for crystallographic work, the aforementioned
RydC sRNA (Fig 1A) is a favorable candidate for crystallization efforts because (i) it is relatively
small and compact (forming a pseudoknot), and (ii) it features multiple U-rich regions that can potentially
bind to both its cognate Hfq (within a single RNP complex) as well as other Hfq proteins across
the lattice. In the crystal structure (Fig 1B, C), the RNA was found to span two Hfq hexamers, forming
intermolecular contacts that helped stitch together a stable crystal lattice.

<na> Because 3D
structures are available for Hfq homologs from many species (Table 1), the phase problem is much simplified
by using MR. Similarly, the phases computed in refining a given apo Hfq structure can then be
used as an initial phase estimate for X-ray data collected for a corresponding Hfq•sRNA complex.

<na> To achieve this, Hfq is often expressed in a
standard E. coli K12 laboratory strain, using a plasmid-based construct created via standard recombinant
DNA techniques. The expression vector, e.g. an inducible T7lac-based system (pET series), can be used
to add various affinity tags to the Nʹ or Cʹ termini of the wild-type sequence.

<na> Un-tagged Hfq has been purified
using immobilized-metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), as the native protein has been shown to
associate with the resin [4]. Poly(A)-sepharose [10] and butyl-sepharose [52,53] columns also have been
utilized to purify untagged Hfq, leveraging the RNA-binding properties and partially hydrophobic nature
of the surface of the protein (respectively).

<q> What may be used for as a single stranded DNA (ssDNA)
biosensor ?

<a> A fluorescently labelled single stranded binding protein (SSB) from
Escherichia coli has been successfully used as a single stranded DNA (ssDNA)
biosensor for monitoring helicase activity (19-23).

<a> Here, we
describe the use of a reagentless mRNA fluorescent biosensor based upon the
single stranded binding (SSB) protein. In this study, SSB showed similar binding
properties to mRNA, to that of its native substrate, ssDNA.

<na> When directly compared
to RT-qPCR, we found the biosensor to be more reproducible with no product lost
through purification. Therefore, the MDCC-SSB is a novel tool for comparative
measurement of mRNA yield following in vitro transcription.

<na> Therefore, it has become clear that there is a need for a low cost, sensitive,
easy to use reagent which can be added to the sample to directly compare in vitro
transcription reactions without additional purification steps. Reagentless,
fluorescence biosensors have been successfully employed in such roles in various
biochemical assays (15-18).

<a> Here, we aim to expand the application of the SSB reagentless biosensor,
showing that, along with ssDNA, it can also be used to measure mRNA. This will
provide a low cost, rapid and sensitive alternative for directly measuring mRNA with
minimal substrate isolation.

<na> To display the functionality and versatility of the
biosensor, we performed two example assays. Firstly, we directly compare the
biosensor to RT-qPCR methodology for determination of transcription products. In
addition, we use the biosensor to determine whether myosin VI motor activity is
required during RNAPII mediated gene expression.

<a> As previously mentioned, SSB was used as a biosensor for ssDNA to report
on the DNA unwinding by helicases. By building upon the work by Dillingham et al
(20), this study used the same SSB mutant, in which the glycine residue at the 26th
position is replaced by a cysteine.

<na> To generate the biosensor, we first needed to select a fluorophore. We opted
to use the commercially available and environmentally sensitive fluorophore, MDCC.
This fluorophore has similar properties to IDCC which was used for the already
published ssDNA biosensor (20).

<na> To determine the suitability of MDCC-SSB as a biosensor to quantify mRNA,
we first needed to establish whether there is a dependence between the
fluorescence intensity increase and the ssRNA concentration. Here, we used ssDNA
as a positive control.

<na> To test whether the biosensor can be added directly into the transcription
samples, without previous purification of the mRNA products, and to assess the
reproducibility of the detection, we setup several in vitro transcription reactions to
generate different lengths of transcript.

<q> Is there water in active site of COQ8 ?

<a> Our previous structure of COQ8 revealed the presence of a water molecule in the active
site bound by the glutamine (Q) of the invariant KxGQ motif that could serve as the nucleophile
for an ATPase reaction (Stefely et al., 2015). As such, we hypothesized that the majority of our
observed ADP production was due to ATP hydrolysis with water, which could be detected by the
production of free phosphate using a malachite green assay.

<na> Systems were solvated with
polarizable CG water and counter ions were added to neutralize the system. Following solvation,
systems were energy minimized with a timestep of 5 fs.

<na> Method for Figure 2D. LC-MS analysis was performed on an Acquity CSH C18 column held at
50 °C (100 mm x 2.1 mm x 1.7 µL particle size; Waters) using (400 µL/min flow rate; Thermo
Scientific). Mobile phase A consisted of 10 mM ammonium acetate in ACN/H2O (70:30, v/v)
containing 250 µL/L acetic acid. Mobile phase B consisted of 10 mM ammonium acetate in
IPA/ACN (90:10, v/v) with the same additives.

<na> Human COQ8A (ADCK3) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Coq8p (collectively COQ8) are UbiB
family proteins essential for mitochondrial coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis. However, the
biochemical activity of COQ8 and its direct role in CoQ production remain unclear, in part due to
lack of known endogenous regulators of COQ8 function and of effective small molecules for
probing its activity in vivo.

<na> To date, the only biochemical activities observed for UbiB family proteins are COQ8 cis
autophosphorylation, which is seemingly spurious, and a low-level COQ8 ATPase activity (Stefely
et al., 2016; Stefely et al., 2015). Additionally, structural analyses revealed that the COQ8 active
site is likely sterically inaccessible to proteinaceous substrates, suggesting that this family
possess unorthodox kinase functionality in lieu of canonical protein kinase activity.

<na> Consistently, we recently found that Coq8p copurifies with
intermediates in the CoQ pathway (Stefely et al., 2016), and have shown that the single-pass
transmembrane domain of COQ8A can induce dimerization (Khadria et al., 2014), together
suggesting that COQ8 activity may particularly be regulated by interactions at the membrane;
however, this remains unexplored.

<na> The CoQ precursors that copurify with Coq8p and UbiB are difficult to synthesize and are
not commercially available; as such, to explore the functional ramifications of these COQ8-ligand
interactions, we opted to screen a variety of CoQ headgroup-like analogs (phenols and
hydroquinones) for their effect on COQ8 activity.

<na> Consistent with our recent results using Coq8p, our binding assays point to a conserved
and selective interaction between COQ8 and precursors in the CoQ biosynthesis pathway.
Curiously, these interactions seem to rely on the integrity of the COQ8 active site and result in an
increase in COQ8 ATPase activity without affecting its inability to phosphorylate proteinaceous
substrates.

<na> Additionally, structural analyses revealed that the COQ8 active
site is likely sterically inaccessible to proteinaceous substrates, suggesting that this family
possess unorthodox kinase functionality in lieu of canonical protein kinase activity.

<na> While the use of
active site point mutants of COQ8 in growth assays have implied the importance of COQ8 catalytic
activity for CoQ production (Stefely et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2011), this has not been tested directly
by chemical inhibition in vivo.

<q> Can we detect a hook effect in a simple linker protein
under conditions found in biochemical systems?

<a> Is the high-dose hook effect dependent on our particular parameter choices? In
this model, we used parameters for dissociation constants and R-to-T transition
that had previously been shown to produce simulation results consistent with the
available literature on calmodulin binding to Calcium under a variety of conditions
[13]. Nonetheless, we repeated the simulations at varying dissociation constants and
varying values of L (which governs the transition between R and T states). As shown
in Additional file 3, a high-dose hook effect exists in a variety of parameter regimes,
although it can be more or less pronounced.

<na> The high-dose hook effect (also called prozone effect) refers to the
observation that if a multivalent protein acts as a linker between two parts of a
protein complex, then increasing the amount of linker protein in the mixture does
not always increase the amount of fully formed complex.

<na> We show that cooperative binding can indeed act as a protective mechanism
against the hook effect. This will have implications in vivo where the extent of
cooperativity of a protein can be modulated, for instance, by allosteric activators
or inhibitors.

<na> This region of antibody concentrations was named
the prozone, and the related observation the ”prozone effect”[1, 2, 3] or (after the
shape of the complex formation curve) the ”high-dose hook effect” (reviewed in
[4, 5]).

<na> This is how cooperative binding works
to counteract the hook effect. Figure 4 shows the cooperative case for the same
values of a, b, and λ as the noncooperative example shown above.

<na> In order to investigate whether we can detect a hook effect in a simple linker protein
under conditions found in biochemical systems (with finite association constants),
we examined the high-dose hook effect using an earlier model of calmodulin activation
by calcium [13].

<a> Calmodulin binding to calcium displays a high-dose hook effect.

<a> As expected, wildtype calmodulin displays a high-dose hook effect, as shown in
the black line in figure 5: If we plot the formation of fully-bound calmodulin (calmCa4)
as a function of the initial calmodulin concentration, then the curve initially
rises, but then drops again at high doses of calmodulin, indicating that calmodulin
molecules compete with each other for calcium binding.

<na> Plotting fully bound calmodulin as
a function of calcium concentration reveals a high-dose hook effect in both cases.
However, despite the R-state only variant reaching a higher peak (due to its higher
overall affinity), it also shows a more pronounced hook effect, with lower absolute
levels of fully bound complex at higher calmodulin concentrations.

<na> Our mathematical treatment and simulations have shown that allosteric regulation
mitigates the hook effect. But what is the relevance of this for calmodulin?
After all, there is no known variant of calmodulin that exists only in the R state
or only in the T state. However, there are allosteric modulators that will stabilise
one of the two states, and they can exist in high concentrations.

<q> Does Puf3p directly regulate Coq5p?

<a> Our biochemical work further demonstrated that Puf3p directly regulates the abundance of Coq5p,
which when overexpressed dramatically reduced yeast growth and CoQ production. These findings
suggest that the CoQ biosynthetic complex can be disrupted when particular subunits are too abundant,
thereby highlighting the importance of stoichiometry for complex Q activity.

<na> How CoQ biosynthesis is coordinated with the biogenesis of OxPhos protein complexes is unclear. Here,
we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-binding protein (RBP) Puf3p directly regulates CoQ
biosynthesis.

<a> The CoQ biosynthesis enzyme
Coq5p is a critical Put3p target: Puf3p regulates the level of Coq5p and prevents its toxicity, thereby
enabling efficient CoQ production.

<na> As described in this report, analysis of our publicly available “Y3K” data set (Stefely et al., 2016a)
reveals an unexpected link between CoQ abundance and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene puf3. The
encoded protein, Puf3p, belongs to the conserved PUF family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which play
key roles throughout Eukarya (Quenault et al., 2011; Spassov and Jurecic, 2003; Wickens et al., 2002).

<na> However, it is unclear whether Puf3p affects
CoQ directly, via control of a key CoQ biosynthesis pathway enzyme, or indirectly, by controlling a protein
that subsequently affects the pathway.

<a> Here, we employ a transomic strategy that analyzes mRNAs, proteins, lipids, and metabolites to
define high-confidence Puf3p targets, and we demonstrate that Puf3p directly regulates CoQ biosynthesis.
In addition to defining a specific Puf3p target responsible for CoQ control—Coq5p—we reveal 90 additional
high-confidence direct targets of Puf3p, which provides insight into how CoQ production is coordinated
with additional OxPhos biogenesis pathways.

<na> The accumulation of PPHB in Dpuf3
yeast was the largest such change across all yeast strains in the Y3K study under fermentation growth
conditions (Figure S1A), further suggesting a functionally important link between Puf3p and the CoQ
pathway.

<na> To test these observations, we overexpressed Puf3p in wild type (WT) or Dpuf3 yeast and
84 examined CoQ pathway lipids. Overexpression of Puf3p in WT yeast suppressed production of PPHB and
85 PPAB (the aminated analog of PPHB)—striking effects because they are the inverse of those observed in
86 Dpuf3 yeast (Figures 1C and S1C–S1E).

<na> Furthermore, plasmid expression of Puf3p recovered CoQ
biosynthesis in fermenting Dpuf3 yeast (Figure 1C). Thus, Puf3p regulates CoQ biosynthesis. We sought
to understand how it does so.

<na> To identify high-confidence Puf3p targets, we integrated data from five experimental methods across four
omic planes (Figure 2A). We first identified Puf3p target mRNAs using data from two independent
approaches: HITS-CLIP (Licatalosi et al., 2008), which uses UV-crosslinking and immunopurification of
RBP-RNA complexes, and RNA Tagging (Lapointe et al., 2015), which employs an RBP-poly(U)
polymerase fusion protein to covalently tag mRNAs bound in vivo with 3’ uridines (“U-tags”) (Figure S2A).

<q> What is the consensus motif for hnRNPA2/B1 to bind RNA?

<a> A transcriptome-wide analysis of hnRNPA2/B1 targets in the nervous
system identified a clear preference for UAG(G/A) motifs confirmed by three independent and complementary in vitro and in vivo
approaches (Hutten and Dormann, 2016; Martinez et al., 2016). This is consistent with previous studies indicating that hnRNPA2/B1
binds specifically to UAGGG, GGUAGUAG or AGGAUAGA sequences(Huelga et al., 2012; Ray et al., 2013). Another recent study
demonstrated that hnRNPA2/B1 recognizes a consensus motif containing UAASUUAU (S=G or C) in the 3’ UTR of many mRNAs
and helps recruiting the CCR4–NOT deadenylase complex (Geissler et al., 2016).

<na> For
most m6 A residues, there was no correlation between m6
A intensity and hnRNPA2/B1 binding, although 12 m6
A sites showed proximal hnRNPA2/B1 binding, which might be the result of coincidental proximity between m6
A and a nonmethylated consensus site recognized by hnRNPA2/B1.

<na> It has recently been demonstrated that hnRNPA2/B1 specifically recognizes m6
A-modified RNAs (Alarcon et al., 2015a). These RNAs share the m6
A consensus sequence RGm6 ACH and directly bind to the m6
A mark with high affinity in vivo and in vitro
(Alarcon et al., 2015a).

<na> hnRNPA2/B1 contains two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) that provide sequence-specific recognition of widespread RNA substrates
including recently reported m6
A-containing motifs. Here we determined the first crystal structures of tandem RRM domains of
hnRNPA2/B1 in complex with various RNA substrates.

<na> As a core component of the hnRNP complex in mammalian cells, hnRNPA2/B1 is an abundant protein and has been implicated in
widespread biological processes. Gene HNRNPA2B1 encodes two protein products A2 and B1 through alternative splicing with B1
protein containing an insertion of 36 nucleotides at its N-terminus (Burd et al., 1989; Kozu et al., 1995).

<na> hnRNPA2/B1 is linked to several biological processes and diseases, especially neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in PrLD in
hnRNPA2/B1 cause multisystem proteinopathy and ALS, through promoting excess incorporation of HNRNPA2/B1 into stress
granules and driving the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions in animal models (Kim et al., 2013). hnRNPA2/B1 also regulates hESC
self-renewal and pluripotency (Choi et al., 2013).

<na> hnRNPA2/B1 has multiple effects on RNA processing. In addition to participating the whole life cycle of mRNAs, hnRNPA2/B1 is
also involved in the activities of many other RNA species. For example, hnRNPA2/B1 can promote association of the long noncoding
RNA HOTAIR with the nascent transcripts of HOTAIR target genes, thus to mediate HOTAIR-dependent heterochromatin
initiation(Meredith et al., 2016).

<na> Physiological functions of hnRNPA2/B1 mostly rely on its RNA-binding activity mainly conferred by its RBD. Although a series of
studies with different approaches have revealed distinct RNA-binding motifs of hnRNPA2/B1, it is difficult to reconcile these data
due to the lack of mechanistic study of RNA selection and binding of hnRNPA2/B1 at the molecular level.

<na> To elucidate the RNA-binding properties of tandem RRMs of hnRNPA2/B1, we purified a number of truncations of the hnRNPA2/B1
protein. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) method, we characterized the RNA-binding activities of each construct with a set
of RNA oligonucleotides of sequences according to previously determined binding motifs.

<na> The tandem RRMs and an RNA molecule are in
one asymmetric unit (Figure 1C); both RRM domains of hnRNPA2/B1 adopt the characteristic RRM fold, which is a typical
β1α1β2β3α2β4 topology consisting of an antiparallel four-stranded sheet adjacent to two helices on the opposite side, similar to
previously determined RRM structures of other RNA-binding proteins using both crystallographic and NMR methods (Daubner et al.,
2013) (Figure 1C).

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/142687

<q> What are the preferences of AcLFS active site?

<a> These findings
indicate that the active site of AcLFS prefers alcohols rather than glycerol and
diols, and suggest that alcohols stay in the pocket with disordered conformations
due to perturbation of their aliphatic portions.

<na> Each structure adopts a single seven-stranded helix-grip fold possessing an
internal pocket. Mutagenesis analysis localized the active site to a layer near the
bottom of the pocket, which is adjacent to the deduced key residues Arg71,
Glu88, and Tyr114.

<a> Solute molecules visible on the active site have suggested
that AcLFS accepts various small alcohol compounds as well as its natural
substrate, and they inhibit this substrate according to their chemistry.

<na> A series of mutagenesis analyses proved
that the active site resides in the Wall region. Specifically, variants of Wall
residues (F84A, Y102A, F104A, Y114A, W133A, W155A) exhibited equivalent
reductions in activities to less than 10%, while those of Floor (L47A, M51A,
L54A, V73A, M118A) and a part of Gate (C107A, T109A, W112Q, M143A)
maintained the activities roughly at the level of the wild type (Fig. 2D).

<na> Concerning an exchange of solute
molecules with 1-PSA at the active site, the flexible linear alcohols would gain
less entropy than diols and glycerol, which would gain entropy due to the
release from the two or more hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3A).

<na> The roles in the catalysis are distinct from
those of regular enzymes since the active site of AcLFS is prepared for
regulating the inherently labile nature of 1-PSA, rather than activating the
substrates into respective transition states.

<na> Finally, we propose a
rational catalytic mechanism based on intramolecular proton shuttling in which
the microenvironment of AcLFS can bypass the canonical [1,4]-sigmatropic
rearrangement principle established by microwave studies.

<na> Crystal structures of AcLFS were determined at a resolution of 1.7 to 2.1 Å
(Table S1). In the present models, the N-terminal region (1–22), which is not
required for the activity (11), was not determined due to conformational disorder.
AcLFS (23–169) formed a single globular domain with dimensions of 40´40´43
Å, consisting of a seven-stranded antiparallel b-sheet (S1–S7), a long a-helix
(H3), two flanking helices (H1, H2), and connecting loops (Fig. 2A).

<na> There are five cysteine residues on the molecular periphery of AcLFS (Fig.
S1A). Inactivation of the free thiols by an excess amount of iodoacetamide
(IAA) caused no significant change in PTSO generation (Fig. 2D).

<na> AcLFS possesses an elongated pocket extending 18 Å from the molecular
surface. This pocket can be divided into three layers, termed Gate, Wall, and
Floor (Fig. 2B).

<q> Is CC3 is necessary for CCCP-1 function?

<a> 2.3 CC3 is necessary for CCCP-1 function

<na> Because CC3 is necessary and sufficient for
CCCP-1 localization in vivo, we tested whether CCCP-1
binds membranes through CC3. In flotation assays,
fragments containing CC3 (that is, CC3 or CC2+3)
floated with the liposomes (Figure 5D, lanes 5 and 6).

<a> We find that the CCCP-1 C-terminal
domain (CC3) has multiple activities. CC3 is necessary and sufficient for CCCP-1 localization and for binding to RAB-
2, and is required for the function of CCCP-1 in DCV biogenesis.

<na> These results are consistent with data showing
that the N-terminal half of human CCCP1/CCDC186
localized to the cytosol and a C-terminal fragment larger
than CC3 localized to perinuclear structures in COS
cells.

<na> Similar to full length
CCCP-1::GFP, CC3::GFP colocalized with RFP::RAB-2
in C. elegans neurons (Figure 1D). Thus, the C-terminal
domain CC3 is both necessary and sufficient for CCCP-
1 localization.

<na> Thus, CC3 is both
necessary and sufficient for CCCP1/CCDC186
localization near immature DCVs and the trans-Golgi.

<na> We also performed GST pull-down
experiments using the CCCP-1 fragments. CC2+3 and
CC3 bound to RAB-2 in a GTP-dependent manner but
CC1+2 did not bind (Figure 3), demonstrating that CC3
is necessary and sufficient for RAB-2 binding.

<na> We found that the localization of CC3 is
also unaltered in the absence of RAB-2 (Figure 1E).
Thus, the CC3 domain has at least two independent
activities: RAB-2 binding and subcellular targeting.

<a> Expression of full-length CCCP-
1 rescued the locomotion defect of cccp-1 mutants
(Figure 4A), but neither CC1+2 nor CC3 rescued (Figure
4B). Thus, CC3 is necessary but not sufficient for
CCCP-1 function.

<na> Because
less CC3 bound to liposomes than full-length CCCP-1,
the binding affinity of CC3 to membranes may be
weaker. However, the CC3 protein was less stable than
the full-length CCCP-1 so the decreased liposome
binding of CC3 may also be due to its decreased
stability.

<q> Where comes glucose to the outer retina from?

<a> Glucose that fuels the outer retina comes from the choroidal blood. Before it can
reach the retina, however, the glucose first must traverse the RPE. The RPE is a
monolayer of polarized cells between the choroid and retina that functions as a
blood-retina barrier.

<a> In this model, glucose from the
choroidal blood supply passes through the retinal pigment epithelium to the retina
where photoreceptors convert it to lactate.

<a> Glucose from the choroid passes through transporters on the
basolateral surface, and then wends its way through the cytoplasm of the RPE
cell. If metabolic enzymes within the RPE cell do not consume it, glucose moves
down a concentration gradient toward the opposite side of the RPE cell where it
exits to the retina through transporters on the apical surface of the RPE.

<na> When the glucose reaches the retina most of it is consumed by glycolysis and
converted to lactate. Retinas and tumors were the two tissues first identified in
the 1920’s by Warburg (13) as relying mostly on “aerobic glycolysis”.

<a> We show that photoreceptors
are the main point of entry for glucose into the retina. The photoreceptors convert
glucose to lactate, which then serves as a fuel for other cells in the retina. We
show here that lactate also can enhance the ability of RPE cells to pass glucose
from the blood to the retina.

<na> Uptake of glucose into cells
requires a protein that can transport glucose. We used immunoblotting of mouse
tissues to evaluate expression of glucose transporters (Fig. 1A) and confirmed
previous findings that GLUT1 is the primary glucose transporter isoform in retina
(24) and RPE (25).

<na> Next we
asked which cells in the retina take up glucose in the context of an eye within a
living animal. We used oral gavage to introduce a fluorescent derivative of 2-
deoxy glucose (2-NBDG) (26) into stomachs of mice. We harvested the retinas
20 or 60 minutes after gavage, mounted them on filter paper and cut slices for
imaging by confocal microscopy (27).

<na> As in mouse retinas, there was no indication of glucose uptake into
MGCs, which in these retinas were marked with tdTomato expressed from a
GFAP promoter (30). Fig. 2D reports quantification and summarizes the
zebrafish retina results.

<na> . We hypothesized that the energy metabolism of
RPE cells might be adapted to minimize consumption of glucose in order to
maximize the amount of glucose that can pass through the RPE to reach the
retina.

<na> These findings support our hypothesis that a slow rate of conversion of glucose
to lactate in the RPE minimizes consumption of glucose so that more glucose
can reach the retina. In a previous study we showed that RPE cells further
minimize their use of glucose by using an alternative pathway known as
reductive carboxylation to make NADPH (9).

<q> Is deadenylation dependent on Repression of the Drosophila nanos mRNA, required for the
formation of the anterior-posterior body axis, depends on the protein Smaug binding to two
Smaug recognition elements (SREs) in the nanos 3' UTR. ?

<a> Deadenylation and
repression both depend on the SREs and, by inference, on Smg, but are independent of
each other. Smg-associated Cup inhibits translation by binding the cap-binding translation
initiation factor eIF4E and competitively displacing eIF4G (Nelson et al. 2004; Jeske et al.
2011).

<na> As a novel
component, the RNA-dependent ATPase Belle (DDX3) was found, and its involvement in
deadenylation and repression of nanos was confirmed in vivo.

<a> Smg regulates nos by binding two Smaug Recognition Elements (SREs) in the nos
3' UTR and recruits the CCR4-NOT complex, which catalyzes mRNA deadenylation
(Semotok et al. 2005; Jeske et al. 2006; Zaessinger et al. 2006).

<na> The CCR4-NOT complex is responsible for Smg-dependent deadenylation (Semotok
et al. 2005; Zaessinger et al. 2006) and associates with SRE-containing RNAs (Jeske et al.
2011). Satisfyingly, all core components of the complex (Not1, Ccr4/Twin, Caf1/Pop2,
Not2/Rga, Not3 and Caf40/Rcd-1) formed a cluster of similar SRE-specific enrichment and
roughly similar abundance; enrichment of NOT10 was less pronounced, and Not11 was even
weaker (Fig. 2E).

<na> To address a role of Bel in nos mRNA deadenylation and decay, we quantified nos
mRNA by RT-qPCR in wild type and bel mutant embryos spanning 1 h intervals during the
first 4 h of embryogenesis. nos mRNA decay was prominent after 2 h in wild type embryos,
but was strongly impaired in bel mutant embryos (Fig. 7B).

<na> For an analysis of the constituents of the SRE-dependent repressor complex, gradient
centrifugation was used as a first purification step. In Fig. 1, radiolabeled, m7G-capped
luciferase RNAs were used carrying a nos 3' UTR fragment with two SREs, either wild type
(SRE+) or with an inactivating point mutation in each (SRE-).

<na> In contrast, western
analyses of RNP complexes isolated by a simple pull-down procedure consistently showed
the PABPC content to be independent of the SREs (Jeske et al. 2011) (Fig. 2D).

<na> Three different biotinylated radiolabeled
RNAs were used, each containing two copies of the SREs: SREonly (200 nt), the 1-AUG nos
RNA used for the MS analysis (630 nt) and the luciferase reporter RNA (1956 nt);
corresponding SRE-RNAs served as controls.

<na> The stoichiometry was between 1 and 2 for all three RNAs.
Within the accuracy of the experiment, this was equimolar with the SREs (see legend to Fig.
S2). Binding of Cup was also approximately stoichiometric with the SREs.

<na> A conceptual assembly of the repressor complex (Fig. 8) starts with Smg binding to
the SREs. Smg binds Cup, which, in turn, associates with the Lsm domain of Tral (Tritschler
et al. 2008; Igreja and Izaurralde 2011).

<q> What effects has P485L mutation?

<a> The P485L mutation causes mislocalization of the glucose transporter
GLUT1.

<na> We therefore selected the P485L mutation in GLUT1 for follow-up
experiments. This mutation causes GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (G1DS), a disorder
characterized by seizures and developmental delays.

<na> To determine the impact of the P485L mutation on the subcellular localization, we
generated stable inducible cell lines expressing epitope tagged full-length wild-type or
mutant GLUT1. While the wild-type protein mainly localized to the plasma membrane,
the P485L mutant showed a more vesicular pattern (Fig. 4 A).

<a> Together, these
data indicate that the P485L mutation causes internalization of Glut1 via AP2-mediated
clathrin-dependent endocytosis.

<a> A, Confocal images of GLUT1 localization in Hek cells stably expressing FLAG-GLUT1
reveal that the wild-type is localized mainly at the cell membrane while the P485L
mutant is mislocalized to cytoplasmic compartments.

<na> P485L Mutation has been introduced by changing c.1454 C>T 122 10 with Q5® Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) Fw:CTGTTCCATCtCCTGGGGGCT,
Rev:CTCCTCGGGTGTCTTGTCAC.

<na> Hek293 cells stably expressing either FLAG-tagged GLUT1 wt or P485L mutant
exhibiting tetracycline-inducible expression were generated using the Flp-In system
developed by Life Technologies according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

<na> Follow-up experiments on GLUT1 (SLC2A1), a glucose
transporter involved in GLUT1 deficiency syndrome, revealed that the mutated protein
mislocalizes to intracellular compartments. A systematic analysis of other known
disease-causing variants revealed a significant and specific overrepresentation of
gained dileucine motifs in cytosolic tails of transmembrane proteins. Dileucine motif
gains thus appear to be a recurrent cause of disease.

<na> First, all three mutations affect transmembrane
proteins -- a calcium channel (CACNA1H) and a glucose transporter (GLUT1) residing
in the plasma membrane and an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR1) in the ER
(Fig. 3 C).

<na> Next we tested whether
the mutant form of GLUT1 was taken up via endocytosis by adding fluorescently labeled
transferrin to GLUT1 expressing cells. In contrast to wild-type GLUT1, the mutant
extensively colocalized with endocytosed transferrin (Fig. 4 B).

<q> Where Class II Hik2 are found?

<a> Class II Hik2 are found
only in three cyanobacterial species; Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421,
Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B'a(2-13), and Synechococcus sp. JA-3-3Ab. Current
phylogenetic trees indicate that these three cyanobacteria diverged very early from
other cyanobacteria (19).

<a> Class II Hik2 proteins are predicted to have no GAF domain. As shown in Table 1,
most cyanobacteria and chloroplasts have a class I Hik2. The least widely distributed
Hik2 is the class II protein that is found only in three cyanobacteria, consistent with
the finding of Ashby et al (14).

<na> Alternatively, the sensor domain of class II Hik2 within those
three cyanobacteria might have been lost after they diverged from a common ancestor
with a sensor domain-containing Hik2.

<na> The predicted sensor domain is shown as
GAF. The kinase core contains the DHp and CA domains. The colour corresponds to
different forms of Hik2 proteins; i.e. blue representing the full-length, class I Hik2
protein and green representing class II Hik2 protein.

<na> Sodium ions have been shown to inhibit the
autophosphorylation activity of Hik2 that precedes phosphoryl transfer to response
regulators, but the mechanism of inhibition has not been determined. We report on the
mechanism of Hik2 activation and inactivation probed by chemical crosslinking and
size exclusion chromatography together with direct visualisation of the kinase using
negative-stain transmission electron microscopy of single particles.

<na> Histidine kinase 2 (Hik2) is one of the three fully conserved histidine kinases found in
cyanobacteria (10). The closest Hik2 homologue in nearly all algae and higher plants
is Chloroplast Sensor Kinase (CSK) (11). A recombinant cyanobacterial Hik2 protein
undergoes autophosphorylation on its conserved histidine residue and transfers the
phosphoryl group to response regulators Rre1 and RppA (12). Rre1 is also modulated
by Hik34 in response to increased temperature (13).

<na> In its unmodified state, Hik2 appears to be autokinase active, and treatment with Na+
ions abolishes its autophosphorylation (12). The exact mechanism by which the
activity of Hik2 is switched off by Na+
ions is not yet clear.

<na> The Hik2 homolog that is
present in almost all cyanobacteria and plants contains a conserved kinase core
domain consisting of DHp and CA together with a GAF sensor domain (11, 12). In
three cyanobacterial species Hik2 is present as a truncated form without a GAF sensor
domain (14).

<na> We have examined the domain architecture and distribution of Hik2
homologs in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. Hik2 domain architecture revealed that
there are two forms of the Hik2 proteins in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.

<na> Hik2 exists in higher-order oligomeric states. An earlier study has shown that
sodium ions inhibit the autophosphorylation activity of full-length Hik2 (12). In order
to elucidate its salt sensing mechanism, we investigated the oligomeric state of Hik2
in a buffer supplemented with or lacking NaCl.

<q> What are the functioning temperatures for GeoCas9?

<na> Here, we
show that the Cas9 protein from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus
stearothermophilus (GeoCas9) catalyzes RNA-guided DNA cleavage over a wide
temperature range and has an enhanced protein lifetime in human plasma.

<a> GeoCas9 is active at temperatures up to 70°C, compared to 45°C for
Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9), which greatly expands the temperature
range for CRISPR-Cas9 applications.

<na> To address these challenges, we tested the thermostable Cas9 protein from
Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GeoCas9). We find that GeoCas9 maintains activity
over a wide temperature range. By harnessing the natural sequence variation of
GeoCas9 from closely related species, we engineered a protospacer adjacent motif
(PAM)-binding variant that recognizes additional PAM sequences and thereby doubles
the number of targets accessible to this system.

<na> The functional
temperature range of GeoCas9 complements that of previously developed Cas9
systems, greatly expanding the utility and stability of Cas9 for both in vitro cleavage and
genome editing applications.

<na> Moreover, the wide temperature range that G. st. occupies22 95
suggested that the Cas9 from this species (GeoCas9) might able to maintain activity at
both mesophilic and thermophilic temperatures (Fig. 1a). Notably, GeoCas9 is
considerably smaller than SpyCas9 (GeoCas9, 1,087 amino acids; SpyCas9, 1,368
amino acids).

<a> We purified GeoCas9 and performed initial thermostability tests using differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), which showed that in the absence of RNA or DNA,
GeoCas9 has a denaturation temperature about 20°C higher than SpyCas9 (Fig. 1d).
Moreover, GeoCas9 denatures at 15°C higher than the slightly thermophilic
Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR III Cas9 (SthCas9) (Fig. 1e).

<na> n addition to the CRISPR loci found in G. st. strains, we also found a type II
CRISPR locus in Geobacillus LC300 containing a Cas9 with ~97% amino acid identity to
the G. st. Cas9. Despite having nearly identical sequences, alignment of these two
homologs of GeoCas9 revealed a tight cluster of mutations in the PAM interacting
domain (PI).

<na> With evidence that GeoCas9 maintains cleavage activity at mesophilic
temperatures, we assessed the ability of GeoCas9 to edit mammalian genomes. We
compared GeoCas9 and SpyCas9 editing efficiency by delivering preassembled
ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) into cultured cells, circumventing differences
between SpyCas9 and GeoCas9 protein expression.

<a> We incubated SpyCas9 and GeoCas9 at a
challenge temperature and added equimolar substrate to test the fraction of RNP that
remained functional. After incubation for 10 min at 45°C, the fraction of active SpyCas9
was greatly reduced (Fig. 5a). In contrast, the fraction of GeoCas9 after incubation at
45°C remained at 100% and not until challenge at 70°C did we detect a decrease in
activity (Fig. 5a).

<na> To test if this is the case for GeoCas9, we incubated SpyCas9 and GeoCas9 in
diluted human plasma at 37°C for 8 hrs and measured the amount of Cas9 activity
remaining (Fig. 5c).

<q> What may be used to assess ribosome activity?

<a> Firefly luciferase (Fluc) was used as a reporter for the
measurement of ribosome activity. We show that using our method, 30S subunits can be
reconstituted under physiological conditions from natural components with 90% activity of native
ribosomes by supplementing 30S ribosome assembly cofactors RimM, RimN, RimP, RbfA, Era
and RsgA.

<na> Synthetic ribosomes in vitro can facilitate engineering translation of novel polymers,
identifying ribosome biogenesis central components, and paving the road to constructing
replicating systems from defined biochemical components.

<na> E. coli ribosome reconstitution or assembly from purified native components into
functionally active 30S and 50S subunits was first achieved under non-physiological conditions
~40 years ago.

<na> By mimicking chemical conditions in the cytoplasm, synthetic ribosomes can be
assembled from in vitro transcribed rRNAs and natural proteins in crude E. coli S150 extracts
under physiological conditions (8). However this system is undefined and it is hard to know
which factors in the extracts facilitate ribosome assembly or modify the rRNAs.

<na> Moreover, we demonstrate that using our method, fully synthetic 30S
ribosomes can be constructed from in vitro synthesized 30S r-proteins and in vitro transcribed
16S rRNA with 17% activity compared to native ribosomes.

<a> Effect of ribosome assembly cofactors on ribosome
reconstitution using our integrated method under physiological conditions with native 16S rRNA
and TP30 as measured by luciferase production.

<na> Moreover, we demonstrate that using our method, fully synthetic 30S
ribosomes can be constructed from in vitro synthesized 30S r-proteins and in vitro transcribed
16S rRNA with 17% activity compared to native ribosomes.

<na> When coupled with native 50S subunits, native 30S subunits exhibited
90% activity of intact native 70S ribosomes, indicating that the recoupling process is not a
bottleneck for ribosome reconstitution in our system. Reconstituted ribosomes from native 16S
rRNA and TP30 were ~40% as active as native 70S ribosomes, possibly due to lack of
assembly cofactors and natural rRNA processing pathways.

<na> We subsequently carried out a series of optimization experiments to increase combined
ribosome assembly and protein synthesis activity, focusing on 16S rRNA: TP30 molar ratio and
the concentration of 30S ribosome assembly cofactors.

<na> Ribosomes reconstituted from in vitro transcribed 16S
rRNA and TP30 with 16S rRNA modification enzymes had ~72% activity of ribosomes
reconstituted from native 16S rRNA and ~33% activity of native 70S ribosomes.

<q> Are OSR1 and SPAK homologues?

<a> Oxidative Stress-Responsive 1 protein
(OSR1) is a close structural homologue of SPAK.
These two kinases share very high sequence
homology: 96% in the N-terminal catalytic region
and 67% in the C-terminal regulatory domain (22).

<na> Here, we report the identification of
the STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich
protein kinase (SPAK) as a novel regulator of
FBXL5 stability.

<na> In this paper, we identify a novel
interaction between FBXL5 and SPAK, a
STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich protein
kinase involved in osmotic regulation.

<na> HEK293
cells in a 6-well plate were transfected with either
BioEase-FBXL5, 3HA-3FLAG-tagged SPAK or
SKP1. The cells were harvested separately and
lysed in IP buffer.

<na> BioEase-FBXL5 was purified
using High Capacity Streptavidin Agarose Resin
(Thermo Scientific), while 3HA-3FLAG-tagged
SPAK and SKP1 were bound to EZview Red
ANTI-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) 1-hour
binding at 4oC on rotisserie rotator.

<na> In addition to previously reported
IRPs (3), this proteomic analysis identified three
additional partners of FBXL5 that function in the
cellular osmotic stress response: WNK1, SPAK
and OSR1 (Figure 1A).

<na> All of SPAK’s known
interacting partners including its upstream kinases
and downstream substrates associate with SPAK
through its conserved C-Terminal (CCT) domain
(21).

<a> In spite of the high degree of
similarity between SPAK and OSR1, mouse
knockout studies revealed that the disruption of
SPAK results in viable animals with
neurobehavioral differences from wild type adults,
while OSR1 knockout causes embryonic lethality
and generates no living pups (22,24).

<a> Although we have focused on
characterizing a potential role for SPAK in
regulating iron homeostasis via its association with
FBXL5, a second plausible possibility for the
relevance of this interaction is that FBXL5
regulates SPAK activity and/or function in the
context of the osmotic stress response. In the
canonical SPAK signaling cascade, osmotic stress
activates the WNK family of kinases which
phosphorylate and activate SPAK and its close
homologue OSR1 and which in turn regulate the
activity of NKCC1, a sodium potassium chloride
transporter that maintains electrolyte and fluid
balance in cells (17).

<na> The identification of SPAK as a key regulator in
both pathways may also suggest that crosstalk
between iron homeostatic and osmotic signaling
pathways is physiologically important.

<q> Does BM212 bind to MmpL3

<a> BM212 binds and directly inhibits MmpL3 function.

<na> Therefore, BM212 inhibits MmpL3 not via indirect effects on the
pmf. To determine if BM212 directly targets MmpL3, we examined the ability of BM212 to
bind physically to purified MmpL3 (SI Appendix, Fig. S11) in vitro.

<a> We demonstrated that
[14 C]-BM212 binds purified wild-type MmpL3 in a saturable manner (Fig. 6A). Furthermore,
we showed that this interaction can be competed away by excess non-labelled BM212 (Fig.
6B), indicating that BM212 can bind specifically to MmpL3.

<a> In fact, mutations in mmpL3
that confer resistance to BM212 mostly cluster in a specific region when mapped onto a
structural model of MmpL3 (Fig. 6C), revealing a possible binding site. We conclude that
BM212 inhibits TMM flipping across the IM by binding MmpL3 directly.

<na> MmpL3, an essential inner membrane (IM) protein, is
implicated in MA transport, but its exact function has not been elucidated. It is believed to be
the cellular target of several anti-mycobacterial compounds; however, evidence for direct
inhibition of MmpL3 activity is also lacking.

<na> Using these assays, we establish the mechanism-of-action of BM212 as a potent MmpL3
inhibitor, and employ it as a molecular probe to demonstrate the requirement for functional
MmpL3 in the transport of MAs across the IM.

<na> Recently, a conserved essential IM protein, MmpL3 (Mycobacterial membrane protein
Large 3), has been implicated in MA transport. Depletion of mmpL3 in Mycobacterium
smegmatis results in accumulation of TMMs and reduced formation of TDMs and AG-linked
mycolates(5, 6), suggesting an impairment in TMM transport to the OM.

<na> Based on its cellular localization, MmpL3 is likely involved in either TMM
flipping across the IM, TMM release from the IM into the periplasm, or both (Fig. 1A). Yet,
its exact role has not been clearly defined, due largely to the lack of functional assays for its
putative transport activity.

<na> Here, we establish that MmpL3 is the MA
flippase at the IM of mycobacteria, and is the molecular target of BM212, a 1,5-diarylpyrrole
compound. We develop assays that selectively access mycolates on the surface of
Mycobacterium smegmatis spheroplasts, allowing us to monitor flipping of MAs across the
IM.

<na> Here, we report that MmpL3 is the TMM flippase at the IM. Using a spheroplast model,
we developed assays to monitor IM topology of TMM. We found that 1,5-diarylpyrrole
BM212 inhibits TMM flipping across the IM in wild-type spheroplasts.

<q> Do acylcarnitine metabolism genes increasingly expressed in response to cold?

<a> The increase in expression of genes involved in acylcarnitine metabolism in response to
cold was surprising, as there is little evidence for the liver’s involvement in adaptive
thermogenesis.

<a> To test which tissues were
contributing to the increase in acylcarnitine levels, we measured the expression of
genes involved in acylcarnitine metabolism in the liver, skeletal muscle, and BAT. In the
liver we found the expression of Cpt1b, Octn2, Cact, Cpt2, and Crat were increased in
response to cold exposure, while the expression of Bbox1, an enzyme involved in
carnitine synthesis, was not changed (Figure 2A).

<na> These data suggest that transcriptional changes in hepatic
acylcarnitine metabolism contribute to the blunted induction in plasma acylcarnitine
levels seen with aging. To test whether the increase in circulating acylcarnitines was
due to brown adipose tissue, we measured LCACs in UCP1-DTA mice that lack BAT.

<na> The observation that liver acylcarnitine metabolism is increased with β3-AR agonist CL-
316,243 (Figure 3A) suggests there may be crosstalk between hepatocytes and cells
that express the β3-AR.

<na> To test whether
the rise in FFAs is required for the changes in hepatic gene expression and
acylcarnitine metabolism, we treated mice with a single dose of the ATGL inhibitor
Atglistatin. Loss of ATGL or Atglistatin treatment prevents cold-induced fatty acid
release from adipocytes (Ahmadian et al., 2011; Haemmerle et al., 2006; Heldmaier and
Seidl, 1985).

<na> A total of 287
circulating lipids significantly changed (p£0.05) in response to cold exposure, and 93
lipids were elevated, while 194 lipids were down-regulated.

<na> . Similar pathways are upregulated
during cold exposure where β3-adrenergic receptor activation leads to increased
triglyceride lipolysis in white adipocytes, and activation of thermogenesis in brown
adipocytes (Lafontan and Berlan, 1993). However, little is known about the metabolic
adaptations that occur in other cell types during acute cold challenge.

<na> These studies led to a previously
unappreciated role for hepatic HNF4a in regulating cold-induced changes in expression
of enzymes involved in hepatic acylcarnitine metabolism.

<na> These changes were also reflected
in the liver by western blot analysis using antibodies that detect Cpt1b and Octn2
(Figure 2B). In contrast, there were no detectable changes in expression of Cpt1b,
Octn2, CrAT, and CACT in the skeletal muscle (Figure S2C), or BAT, except for
increased expression of Octn2 (Figure 2C).

<na> To test
whether CL-316,243 stimulates hepatic gene expression of enzymes involved in
acylcarnitine metabolism as well, we measured Cpt1b, Octn2, Cpt1a, Cact, Cpt2, and
Crat mRNA, and found an induction in the liver (Figure 3B), with little effects seen in
BAT (Figure S3A).

<q> Has Gbb38 plays similar role as Gbb15?

<a> Together, these findings indicate that
Gbb38 is an active ligand with functions distinct
from Gbb15. However, it is not exactly clear how
cleavage influences the maturation of either ligand,
or whether the prodomain impacts ligand activity
and/or influences receptor preference.

<na> Cleavage at the S1 or
atypical S0 site produces Gbb15, the conventional
small BMP ligand, while cleavage at the NS site produces
the larger Gbb38 ligand (1, 2).

<na> We found that the ability of Gbb38
to signal requires the expression of either Wit or
the type I receptor, Saxophone (Sax). Finally, we
discovered that the production of Gbb38 in 3rd instar
larvae results when processing at the S1/S0 site
is blocked by O-linked glycosylation.

<na> Cleavage at the NS
site produces a large ligand, Gbb38, whereas cleavage
at the C-terminal S1 site produces the conserved
smaller ligand, Gbb15. In many tissues, Gbb38 is
more abundant than Gbb15 (1).

<na> Given the
differences in Gbb38 and Gbb15 accumulation between
tissues (1), we considered the possibility that
the Gbb prodomain is involved not only in regulating
the production of specific ligand forms but also their
signaling output.

<na> When S1 cleavage is blocked
(mS1), the most abundant product is Gbb38, and
the NH3
-NS fragment is also detected in the media
(Fig. 1B-D). The appearance of NS-S0 and the low
abundance of Gbb15, when compared to total Gbb
ligands (22%, 95% CL 9%-35%, Fig. S2A), indicate
that when S1 is mutated, some cleavage most
likely occurs at the atypical S0 site (Fig. 1B, C).

<na> To eliminate
contributions of other signaling mechanisms
that could modulate Gbb activity, we directly measured
the activity of the secreted forms of Gbb15
and Gbb38 and compared their signaling kinetics.

<na> Gbb15 produced by wild-type gbb (Fig. 1C, D),
we adjusted the cleavage mutant conditioned media
so that ligand concentrations were equivalent,
using conditioned media from EV expressing cells.

<na> Therefore,
we conclude that the activity of Gbb15 is reduced in
the presence of the uncleaved prodomain (NH3
-S1) suggesting that a failure to cleave the prodomain at
the NS site can antagonize Gbb15-induced signaling.

<na> Overall,
we conclude that Gbb38 can effectively elicit signaling
through complexes that contain either the type
I receptor Sax or the type II receptor Wit, and exhibits
high levels of signaling in the presence of both.
Furthermore, when NS cleavage is blocked in the
presence of Sax and Wit, the uncleaved prodomain
increases Gbb15 signaling activity

<q> Does AcrIIA4 bind to Cas9?

<a> We show here that the anti-CRISPR protein AcrIIA4 binds only to
assembled Cas9-single guide RNA (sgRNA) complexes and not to Cas9 protein
alone. A 3.9 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the Cas9-sgRNA-AcrIIA4 complex
revealed that the surface of AcrIIA4 is highly acidic and binds with 1:1
stoichiometry to a region of Cas9 that normally engages the DNA protospacer
adjacent motif (PAM).

<na> Consistent with this binding mode, order-of-addition
experiments showed that AcrIIA4 interferes with DNA recognition but has no
effect on pre-formed Cas9-sgRNA-DNA complexes.

<na> The 87 amino acid anti-
CRISPR-Cas9 protein AcrIIA4 is notable in both respects: it inhibits multiple Cas9
proteins including the widely used Cas9 ortholog from Streptococcus pyogenes (Spy),
and it blocks Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells (3). To investigate the
molecular basis for AcrIIA4-mediated Cas9 inhibition, we first tested whether
recombinant AcrIIA4 protein interacts directly with SpyCas9 (Fig. 1A).

<na> Purified AcrIIA4
was incubated with SpyCas9 in the presence or absence of a single-guide RNA
(sgRNA) that assembles with Cas9 to provide sequence-specific DNA recognition (4).

<a> Furthermore, the AcrIIA4-bound Cas9-sgRNA complex is more resistant to proteolytic
digestion than the Cas9-sgRNA complex alone, implying that AcrIIA4 stabilizes a
particular Cas9 conformation (fig. S2).

<na> An
atomic model for AcrIIA4 was built from reconstruction 1. The EM density map displays
excellent main-chain connectivity and side-chain densities for almost all residues of
AcrIIA4 (fig. S5).

<a> De novo model building demonstrated that AcrIIA4 binds to Cas9 with 1:1
stoichiometry and comprises a three-stranded antiparallel β sheet flanked by one alpha-
helix at the amino-terminal end and two α helices on the carboxy-terminal end
(α1β1β2β3α2α3).

<na> CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology is derived from a microbial adaptive
immune system, where bacteriophages are often the intended target. Natural
inhibitors of CRISPR-Cas9 enable phages to evade immunity and show promise
in controlling Cas9-mediated gene editing in human cells.

<na> Determination of the molecular basis for Cas9 inhibition could shed light on
the evolutionary “arms race” between phage and bacteria, as well as suggest new
approaches to regulate genome editing in eukaryotic cells.

<na> n both cryo-EM reconstructions, the density for the HNH domain of Cas9 was
weaker than for the rest of the structure, consistent with the previously observed
conformational plasticity of the HNH nuclease domain in the pre-targeting state. An
atomic model for AcrIIA4 was built from reconstruction 1.

<q> Can glutathione system reduce thioredoxins?

<a> By assessing the cross-
talk between these systems, we show for the first time, that the glutathione system can reduce
thioredoxins that are poor substrates for thioredoxin reductase (Thioredoxin-like protein 1 and
Thioredoxin 2) and thioredoxins that lack access to thioredoxin reductase (Thioredoxin 2).

<na> In P. falciparum, antioxidant proteins of the glutathione and thioredoxin systems are
compartmentalized. Some subcellular compartments have only a partial complement of these
proteins.

<na> These systems
achieve detoxification through thiol-disulphide exchange reactions and are comprised of two
major branches: the glutathione and the thioredoxin systems.

<na> The thioredoxin system consists of the small redox-active
proteins thioredoxins (Trx), thioredoxin like proteins (Tlp), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR),
thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx), peroxiredoxins (Prx) and Plasmodium-specific plasmoredoxin
(Plrx) [1,2,8].

<na> The resulting model of the parasite
antioxidant network suggested that key sub-cellular locations in the parasite were lacking a few
components of the thioredoxin and glutathione systems.

<na> Similarly, we
show that thioredoxins from the parasite can, in turn, reduce glutathione and act as a backup
for the lack of glutathione reductase in a particular subcellular compartment.

<na> All thioredoxins and the
thioredoxin reductase were expressed in E.coli BL21-DE3 with His-tags. Expressed proteins were
purified by Ni2+ 91 -NTA column chromatography according to the protocol specified by the
manufacturer (Ni2+ 92 -NTA superflow cartridge, Qiagen).

<na> Thioredoxin reduction by the glutathione system was tested using insulin reduction assays.
Here, DTT was replaced with glutathione as a reducing agent. Thus, protein disulphide
reductase activity of thioredoxins would be observed only if thioredoxins were reduced by
glutathione.

<na> Additionally, assays
carried out without thioredoxins confirmed that glutathione alone does not result in insulin
reduction. The activity for each thioredoxin at different concentrations was expressed as a
slope of a linear part of a turbidity curve to the lag time reported as Δ600·min-2 x 10-3 132 .

<na> In order to understand alternative mechanisms for the reduction of these thioredoxins,
we performed biochemical assays using Trx-dependent insulin reduction. In these assays, DTT
was replaced with glutathione as a reducing agent. Therefore, protein disulphide reductase
activity of thioredoxins would only be observed if the thioredoxins were reduced by
glutathione.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/126458

<q> Does DNA-binding domain bind to MED25?

<a> Here we report that both the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and the N-terminal
activation domain (AD) of ETV4 bind to the activator interacting domain (ACID) of
MED25. Both domains contribute to a higher-affinity interaction with MED25, as
compared to ETS factors outside of the ETV1/4/5 subfamily.

<na> These ETV4 regions bind MED25 independently, display distinct kinetics, and
combine to contribute to a high-affinity interaction of full-length ETV4 with MED25.
Within the ETS family, high-affinity interactions with MED25 are specific for the ETV1/4/5
subfamily as other ETS factors display weaker or no detectable binding.

<na> MED25 also stimulates the in
vitro DNA binding activity of ETV4 by relieving autoinhibition. ETV1/4/5 factors are often
overexpressed in prostate cancer and genome-wide studies in a prostate cancer cell line
indicate that ETV4 and MED25 occupy enhancers that are enriched for ETS-binding
sequences and are both functionally important for the transcription of genes regulated by
these enhancers.

<na> For example, in addition to ETV5 the transcription factors
ATF6α, HNF4α, RARα, SOX9, and the viral protein VP16 recruit the variable subunit
MED25 to their respective target genes [30, 43, 50-53]. The SOX9-MED25 interaction is
implicated in chondrogenesis because reduced expression of either component results
in similar palatal malformations in zebrafish [53].

<na> Here we investigate the biochemical basis and functional implications of ETV4-
MED25 interactions. High-affinity interaction with MED25 was specific to the ETV1/4/5
subfamily, whereas, other ETS factors bound to MED25 with lower affinity, or not at all.

<na> MED25 activated the DNA binding of ETV4
by relieving a previously described autoinhibition mechanism. Full-length ETV4, bearing
both regions, had higher affinity for MED25 than either domain alone.

<na> However, the DBD also interacted with two additional, distinct
sites on MED25, such that simultaneous occupancy was possible in spite of overlapping
contact surfaces. We provided in vivo evidence for the importance of this interaction as
MED25 and ETV4 occupancies were highly overlapping genome-wide, and there was a
significant overlap in genes whose expression was affected by depletion of either factor.

<na> We next sought to investigate the molecular basis of selectivity for high-affinity
interaction between the ETV1/4/5 subfamily and MED25 ACID.

<na> Notably, the predominantly disordered AD becomes more
helical in the MED25-bound state and phenylalanine and tryptophan residues in the AD
are critical for this interaction [7, 30].

<na> Therefore, we focused on characterizing residues that are
important for the newly discovered interaction between the DBD of ETV4 and MED25.

<q> What do Bowman-Birk Inhibitors (BBI) inhibit?

<a> BBI are inhibitors of trypsin and chymotrypsin type serine proteases. They are small proteins of
masses 6 to 9 kDa, characterized by two homologous domains that together form a structure
stabilized by seven conserved disulfide bridges.

<a> Bowman-Birk Inhibitors (BBI) – a class of serine protease inhibitors is of considerable
interest due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties. Recent efforts have
focused on understanding the structure and dynamics of these inhibitors, and the molecular
mechanism behind its bioactive properties.

<a> More recently, BBI from soybean has been shown to inhibit HIVreplication
in macrophages. It is expected that a detailed understanding of the structure-function
relationship of these enigmatic molecules would be immensely valuable in designing new anticancer
therapies.

<na> In monocots however, BBI’s have only a single reactive site for protease inhibition.
Additionally, a larger group of BBI’s of mass 16 kDa exists, suggested to have formed as a result
of gene duplication after the divergence of monocots and dicots.

<na> In many dicots, the 8kDa
double-headed BBI form highly stable dimers which appear as 16 kDa species in gel filtration and
SDS-PAGE.20–22 Particularly, dry Horse Gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum/Dolichos biflorus) seeds
have four characterized isoforms of BBI (HGI-I to HGI-IV). With almost identical sequences
differing only at the N-terminal region, all of them exist as dimers in physiological conditions
(Table 1).

<na> Incidentally, inspection of the crystal structure of Cowpea
BBI bound to trypsin showed the presence of a positively charged pocked in vicinity of the trypsin
active site which might bind the N-terminal Asp. Taking these observations into perspective, we
propose a model of dimer to monomer transition that is consistent with experimental observations.
The dimer interface stabilized by the ATLP loop remains stable until the inhibitor interface comes
in vicinity of trypsin.

<na> In summary, based on the present computational analysis, we have attempted to unify and explain
the experimental results obtained regarding Horse Gram BBI forms. The biological requirement
of different isoforms of HGI in dry and germinated seeds is not fully understood.

<na> The two distinct binding
sites, Anti-Trypsin-Loop (ATL) and Anti-Chymotrypsin Loop (ACL), afford the protein the ability
to independently as well simultaneously bind and inhibit two proteases in a 1:1:1 ternary complex,
apart from forming 1:1 complexes with trypsin/chymotrypsin.

<na> Interestingly, in germinated Horse Gram seeds, these inhibitors exist as monomeric
isoforms which is attributed to the proteolytic truncation of the N and C-terminal ends of HGI.
Three different Horse Gram Germinated Inhibitors (HGGI-I, II and III) have been identified and
characterized (Table 1).

<na> Molecular Dynamics calculations to analyze the general stability and dynamics of the inhibitor
dimer and to identify prominent interactions that are involved in dimerization. Using REST225
sampling method, we have attempted to identify most probable structures of the flexible N and C
terminals and based on the analysis proposed a model to explain the existence of HGI-III as a
dimer. Results obtained and conclusion drawn have been compared with previous experimental
results wherever possible.

<q> How conserved are SCF complexes?

<a> SCF complexes are highly conserved from flies to humans: SkpA is 77% identical
to human Skp1, Cul1 is 63% identical, and Slmb is 80% identical to its human homologs,
B-TrCP1 and B-TrCP2. We therefore tested the interaction of Flag-tagged Drosophila
SCF components with endogenous human SMN in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2D).

<na> Using this approach, we have
demonstrated that the SCFSlmb E3 ligase complex interacts with a degron embedded
within the self-oligomerization domain of SMN. Our findings establish plausible
connections to disease-relevant cellular processes and signaling pathways.

<na> We used a Drosophila model system and label-free proteomics to
identify the SCFSlmb ubiquitin E3 ligase complex as a novel SMN binding partner.
SCFSlmb interacts with a phospho-degron embedded within the human and fruitfly SMN
YG-box oligomerization domain.

<na> SMN is the
central component of a multimeric protein assemblage known as the SMN complex
(Matera and Wang 2014; Li et al. 2014). The best-characterized function of this complex,
which is found in all tissues of metazoan organisms, is in the cytoplasmic assembly of
small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), core components of the spliceosome
(Fischer et al. 1997; Meister et al. 2001; Pellizzoni et al. 2002).

<na> The best-characterized function of this complex,
which is found in all tissues of metazoan organisms, is in the cytoplasmic assembly of
small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), core components of the spliceosome
(Fischer et al. 1997; Meister et al. 2001; Pellizzoni et al. 2002).

<na> Using this system, we carried out
proteomic profiling of Flag-purified embryonic lysates and identified the SCFSlmb E3
ubiquitin ligase complex as a novel SMN interactor. Importantly, this interaction is
conserved from flies to humans.

<na> Substitution of a conserved serine (S270A) interferes
with SCFSlmb binding and stabilizes SMNΔ7. SMA-causing missense mutations that block
multimerization of full-length SMN are also stabilized in the degron mutant background.
Overexpression of SMNΔ7S270A, but not wild-type SMNΔ7, provides a protective effect in
SMA model mice and human motor neuron cell culture systems.

<na> Altogether, these data demonstrate a conserved interaction
between SMN and the SCFSlmb/B-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.

<na> As shown in Fig. 4A, we identified a putative
Slmb/B-TrCP degron (269MSGYHT274) in the highly conserved self-oligomerization
domain (YG Box) of human SMN. Interestingly, this sequence was previously identified
as part of a larger degron motif (268YMSGYHTGYYMEMLA282) that was thought to be
created in SMN∆7 by SMN2 alternative splicing (Cho and Dreyfuss 2010).

<na> As shown, the vSmnS201A and
vSMNΔ7A constructs exhibited increased protein levels compared to their serine
containing counterparts, whereas levels of the S201D mutants were reduced, suggesting
that the phospho-degron motif identified in human SMN∆7 (Cho and Dreyfuss 2010) is
also conserved in the fly protein.

<q> How frequent is glioma?

<a> Gliomas are the most frequent primary tumors of the central nervous system,
accounting for more than 60% of all brain tumors [1]. Among them, glioblastoma
(GBM) is the most common aggressive glioma, and the average survival rate remains
low [2].

<na> Canonical signaling pathways were analyzed to better understand the biological
features of glioma. Alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4), which was involved in VEGF signaling,
decreased in the urine of three rats, which is consistent with a previous study’s finding
that ACTN4 plays a role in the development and progression of glioma [21].

<na> In the acute phase
response signaling, acute-phase proteins, such as complement C3 and C-reactive
protein, which may reflect the inflammation and activation of the innate immune
system during the course of glioma [24, 25].

<na> NGAL protein may also be involved in glioma drug
resistance and clinical prognosis [30]. Ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor subunit
alpha, which participates in the formation of tumor-initiating cells in gliomas, is a
marker that correlates with histological grade [31].

<na> s. Chloride intracellular channel protein 1 expression presented a correlation
with glioma, as higher expression levels were observed in tumor tissues [36]. GSTP1
was reported to show higher expression levels in meningeal tumors and GBM [37].

<na> The lysosomal marker cathepsin D (CATD), which was
identified on the 6th day, was frequently overexpressed in glioblastomas [35]. The
above differential proteins identified during the early stage may help in providing
clues for the early diagnosis of the disease.

<na> Liu, M.F., Jin, T., Shen, J.H., Shen, Z.Y., Zheng, Z.C. et al.（2011）NGAL and NGALR are frequently
overexpressed in human gliomas and are associated with clinical prognosis. J Neurooncol
104： 119-27.

<na> Ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor subunit
alpha, which participates in the formation of tumor-initiating cells in gliomas, is a
marker that correlates with histological grade [31].

<na> Most of the differentially expressed proteins that had not been reported to be
associated with GBM in other studies may also play an important role and serve as
new markers during the progression of this disease. For example, secreted
phosphoprotein 24, a bone matrix protein that can suppress pancreatic cancer growth
[39] and lung cancer [40], may also be potential urinary markers of GBM.

<na> Compared to the urinary biomarker panel of another cancer, ovarian carcinoma, the
protein changes in this study were substantially different. Distinct differential proteins
were present in GBM and ovarian carcinoma [45].

<q> Can biflavonoids modulate splicing?

<na> We tested a set of bioflavonoids for a potential effect on pre-mRNA
splicing in vitro, including amentoflavone, cupressuflavone,
hinokiflavone and sciadopitysin (Figure 1A). As a positive control
we included the previously reported biflavonoid splicing inhibitor,
isoginkgetin.

<na> . Initially, we screened each compound at a high final
concentration (500 µM), for a potential inhibitory effect on splicing
of the model Ad1 and HPV18 E6 pre-mRNAs, using HeLa nuclear
extract in conjunction with a non-radioactive RT-PCR in vitro
splicing assay (see Methods).

*<a> Cupressuflavone did not inhibit
splicing under these conditions, while hinokiflavone,
amentoflavone, isoginkgetin and sciadopitysin all showed some
inhibition of in vitro splicing of the adenovirus and/or the HPV18E6
pre-mRNAs.

<a> The strongest inhibitory effects were obtained with
hinokiflavone and amentoflavone, which had not previously been
identified as affecting the spliceosome (Figure 1B). We note that
the active compounds each have a linkage connecting the B and
A’ units of the two flavone moieties.

<na> Using RT-PCR and
primer pairs to detect changes in exon skipping of RBM5, FAS and
MCL1 pre-mRNAs, as well as intron inclusion in HSP40 and
RIOK3 pre-mRNAs, no alteration of pre-mRNA splicing for these
transcripts were detected in the presence of these bioflavonoids.

<a> Here, we identify the plant biflavanoid hinokiflavone as an inhibitor
of splicing in vitro and modulater of alternative splicing in multiple
human cell lines. Hinokiflavone inhibits splicing in vitro by blocking
one or more early steps of spliceosome assembly, leading to
accumulation of the A complex.

<na> Hinokiflavone also inhibited
the catalytic activity of purified E. coli expressed SUMO protease,
SENP1 in vitro, indicating the increase in SUMOylated proteins
results primarily from inhibition of de-SUMOylation.

<a> This
identified the biflavone hinokiflavone as a new general splicing
modulator active both in vitro and in cellulo. Further analysis
indicated that hinokiflavone promotes unique changes in
subnuclear structure and dramatically increases SUMOylation of a
subset of spliceosome proteins by inhibiting SENP protease
activity.

<na> Thus, in HeLa and
HEK293 cells, hinokiflavone promoted exon 2 skipping, whereas,
in NB4 cells, multiple, aberrant alternatively spliced MCL1 isoforms
were detected.

<na> Hinokiflavone also promoted intron 3 and
intron 4 retention in the DXO transcripts and exon 4 skipping in the
EIF4A2 transcripts in all cell lines and at all concentration tested.

<q> What was the result of deleting INLP genes?

<a> In addition, the deletion of
INLP biosynthetic genes in M. marinum has decreased the intracellular metal concentration,
suggesting the role of this biosynthetic gene cluster in metal transport.

<na> Based on both in vivo reconstitution and in vitro biochemical analysis, we
scrutinized the timing and substrate specificity of these enzymes in INLP biosynthesis.
Additionally, a mutagenesis study in M. marinum suggests that this biosynthetic gene cluster
plays a role in metal acquisition.

<na> We have thus proposed putative enzymatic
pathways for INLP biosynthesis (Fig. 3). 2 is presumably generated through a hybrid AALNRPS
assembly line-based mechanism. The assembly line starts with the activation of crotonic
acid by ScoC through adenylation, and the adenylated acid is loaded onto an ACP (ScoB) for
further processing.

<na> To further confirm the role of MmaA-E in INLP biosynthesis, we reattempted the in vivo
reconstitution of activities of MmaA-E in E. coli. Based on the substrate specificity of MmaC,
we reasoned that the in vivo substrate limitation could be the reason for the failed INLP
production by E. coli-mmaA-E. 2-decenoic acid or 2-dodecenoic acid was then fed to the culture
of E. coli-mmaA-E and untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed to search for new
metabolites.

<na> The INLP alcohols could not be detected, suggesting that 2-decenoic acid and 2-dodecenoic
acid may not be the native substrate for the M. marinum proteins, which led to the impaired
activity of AAL-NRPS assembly line and low titers of the corresponding INLPs in E. coli.

<na> . In silico analysis demonstrated that putative heavy metal translocating
P-type ATPases such as CtpA and CtpB are encoded in close proximity to the INLP biosynthetic
genes in the M. tuberculosis and M. marinum genomes (Fig. S1), and the expression of CtpB
was shown to be co-regulated with Rv0096-0101 in M. tuberculosis by transcriptomic analysis.

<na> Future study of native INLP
metallophores in mycobacteria and their mode of action during infection may inspire new
therapies to combat pathogenic mycobacteria, in particular M. tuberculosis, from which millions
of people die every year.

<na> A putative lipopeptide biosynthetic gene cluster is conserved in many species of
Actinobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. marinum, but the specific function
of the encoding proteins has been elusive.

<na> An in silico homology search has revealed that gene clusters homologous to Rv0096-0101
are conserved in pathogenic mycobacteria, such as M. bovis, M. leprae, M. marinum, M.
ulcerans and M. abscessus (Fig. 1), while absent in non-pathogenic mycobacteria such as M.
smegmatis, providing further indication of the virulence-associated nature of the locus product in
mycobacteria.

<na> We next constructed a mutant strain of M.
marinum devoid of mmaA-E through allelic exchange according to the reported method (42), and
the intracellular metal content of the M. marinum wild-type and ΔmmaA-E was determined to
probe the function of these genes.

<q> How to effectivly organize in vivo
preservation of enzymes in the dry state?

<a> Lacking of the preincubation step resulted
in the loss of luciferase activity after rehydration. We showed that preincubation with trehalose
associated to induction of desiccation-tolerant related genes in Pv11 cells allowed effective in vivo
preservation of enzymes in the dry state.

<a> Stable luciferase expressing Pv11 were newly generated in order to examine the
preservation of exogenous enzyme activity in the dry state. This study shows that desiccated Pv11-
Luc cells protect the exogenously expressed luciferase against physicochemical damages occurring
during drastic increase of endogenous ion concentrations and osmotic pressures due to desiccation
stress.

<na> . To control the process of freeze-drying, high-energy
and expensive equipment are required13. In this study, we proposed a novel preservation
technology for enzymes in a dry state without chilling steps.

<na> Therefore, essential proteins involved in the basic
metabolism for the cell survival are preserved despite the almost complete dehydration. These cells
may be used to preserve a protein of interest in the dry state without relying on expensive electric
power supply.

<na> However, enzyme preservation using yeast is insufficient for
long-term storage in a dry state at ambient temperature in terms of duration and RH conditions for
dehydration. Desiccation tolerance in yeast does not only rely on anhydroprotectants but also on
the cell wall creating effective protection for constitutive proteins.

<na> However, even a yeast
equipped with such physical properties can barely protect an enzyme in the dry state for long-term
storage. Since completely dried Pv11 cells were capable to survive up to 251 days at room
temperature24, intrinsically expressed anhydroprotectants in this system may contribute preserve
exogenous enzymes in vivo.

<na> To control the process of freeze-drying, high-energy
and expensive equipment are required13. In this study, we proposed a novel preservation
technology for enzymes in a dry state without chilling steps.

<na> Accumulated trehalose, due to dehydration in yeast cells, contributed slightly to the
preservation of luciferase activity27. However, enzyme preservation using yeast is insufficient for
long-term storage in a dry state at ambient temperature in terms of duration and RH conditions for
dehydration.

<na> We examined whether a desiccation-sensitive mammalian HEK293T cells maintained luciferase
activity after dry preservation (Fig. 4). The process of preincubation with trehalose, desiccation and
rehydration was performed according to the same protocol used for Pv11-Luc cells.

<na> The presence of 600 mM trehalose plus 10% IPL-41 insect medium (i.e. loss of
both BSA and FBS) gave little effect of luciferase preservation. The presence of BSA at a molar ratio
of 10:1 (BSA/Luc) also did not show significant enzyme protection compared to that observed in
absence of BSA. Significant luciferase activity was observed in presence of BSA at a molar ratio of
50:1 (BSA/Luc).

<q> How oxygen consumption is determined?

<a> The oxygen consumption due to non-mitochondrial sources was determined
using 10 µM Antimycin A (Sigma-Aldrich) and was subtracted to the basal respiration and maximal
respiratory capacity values. The spare respiratory capacity (SRC) was calculated from the maximal
respiratory capacity minus basal respiration. Oxygen consumption was expressed as
nanoatoms/(min)(mg of cells).

<a> The oxygen consumption was measured polarographically at 28 ºC using a Clark detector (YSI, model
5,300, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). The S. cerevisiae cultures were harvested at mid-log phase (D.O. 600
∼ 0.5; exponential phase yeast culture) or fifteen days after inoculation (chronologically aged yeast
culture) at 5000 x g for 5 minutes at 28 ºC. Subsequently, 125 mg of cells were resuspended in 5 mL of
buffer 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES-TEA; Sigma-Aldrich), adjusted to pH 6.0
with triethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in a closed chamber with constant stirring.

<na> To prove this hypothesis, the chronological life span (CLS) of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae was studied as it is accepted as an important model of oxidative damage and aging. In
addition, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
release were measured in order to determine the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction.

<na> However, at low-level glucose, oxygen consumption was inhibited in yeast cultures in the
exponential phase as well as in chronologically aged cultures. Furthermore, RSV supplementation
promoted the polarization of the mitochondrial membrane in both cultures.

<na> One-way ANOVA was applied to test for the
differences in oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and H2O2 release,
followed by Dunnett’s test.

<na> Oxygen consumption is an indicator of the function of the electron transport chain and proton leakage
caused by the F1F0-ATPase. Therefore, in order to evaluate whether the decrease of cell viability by
RSV at standard and lower concentrations of glucose is related to OXPHOS activity, oxygen
consumption analysis was performed in yeast cultures in the exponential phase and chronologically
aged (15 days of age) with the same levels of RSV and glucose used in the CLS assay.

<na> Overall, these results indicate that RSV supplementation impairs oxygen consumption in low-glucose
conditions in exponential phase yeast cultures, which probably exerts a negative impact in cell viability
and CLS.

<na> The mitochondrial membrane potential was measured in order to corroborate whether the effect on
oxygen consumption occasioned by RSV is due to an alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential.

<na> Second, at highlevel
glucose RSV supplementation increases oxygen consumption in exponential phase yeast cultures,
but inhibits it in chronologically aged yeast cultures. However, at low-level glucose, oxygen
consumption was inhibited in both yeast cultures, exponential phase and chronologically aged.

<na> A growing number of studies have determined that RSV supplementation disrupts the activity of the
electron transport chain between complex I (Moreira et al. 2013), and III and in the F1F0-ATPase
(Gledhill et al. 2007). This phenotype exerts a direct impact on oxygen consumption within cells. For
example, it has been reported that RSV (50 µM) supplementation decreased oxygen consumption in
mouse colon cancer CT-26 cells (Sassi et al. 2014) and in human embryonic kidney cells supplemented
with 300 µM RSV (Hawley et al. 2010).

<q> How error prone is Pol IV
transcription?

<a> Here, we show that Pols IV and V differ from one
another, and Pol II, in nucleotide incorporation rate, transcriptional accuracy and the
ability to discriminate between ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides. Pol IV
transcription is notably error-prone, which may be tolerable, or even beneficial, for
biosynthesis of siRNAs targeting transposon families in trans.

<na> By contrast, Pol V
exhibits high fidelity transcription, suggesting a need for Pol V transcripts to faithfully
reflect the DNA sequence of target loci in order to recruit siRNA-Argonaute protein
silencing complexes.

<na> Remarkably,
plants have two additional nuclear RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, each composed
of 12 subunits (1), at least seven of which are shared with Pol II, from which Pols IV and
V evolved (2-5).

<na> Pol IV partners with RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2
(RDR2) to generate short double-stranded RNAs that serve as precursors for dicing into
24 nt siRNAs (6-8). These siRNAs are then incorporated into an Argonaute protein,
primarily AGO4, and guide cytosine methylation and repressive chromatin modifications
to loci transcribed by Pol V (9-11).

<na> However, the catalytic properties of Pol IV and Pol V, relative to Pol
II, remain unknown. In this study, we conducted tests to compare several parameters of
Pol II, Pol IV and Pol V catalytic activity.

<a> We find that Pols IV and V catalyze RNA
synthesis more slowly than Pol II and we show that Pol IV transcription is error-prone.
Surprisingly, Pol V is less error-prone than Pol II, at least in terms of misincorporating
ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) mismatched to the DNA template.

<na> Comparing the ratio of properly arrested (20 nt) to misincorporation
products (>20 nt), reveals that Pol IV generates the most misincorporation products,
and Pol V the fewest (Fig. 1B). Subsequent tests comparing misincorporation
frequency in the presence of 100 µM UTP, CTP, GTP or ATP confirmed that Pol IV is
considerably more error-prone than Pols II or V, and that Pol V is the least error-prone
of the three enzymes; this was true for all template and NTP combinations tested (Fig.
1C).

<na> To test this possibility,
we compared Pol IV isolated from wild-type RDR2 plants, Pol IV isolated from a rdr2-1
null mutant background, and Pol IV that is inactivated as a result of clustered point
mutations in the Metal A site of the catalytic center, but expressed in a wild-type RDR2
background (16).

<na> We tested whether Pol IV and Pol V
active sites are similarly sensitive to manganese. Indeed, substituting manganese for
magnesium in the reaction buffer substantially increased nucleotide misincorporation by
Pols IV and V, as for Pol II (Fig. 1E).

<na> To assess the contribution of nucleotide selectivity to Pol II, IV and V
transcriptional fidelity, we compared the relative affinities of the enzymes for
complementary versus non-complementary nucleotides during RNA elongation (18).

<q> What is Lolium rigidum?

<a> Lolium rigidum (Gaud.) is a genetically diverse, cross-pollinated weed species that is widespread in the
southern Australian cropping system and has evolved resistance to many different herbicide modes of
action (reviewed by Yu and Powles, 2014).

<a> The evolution of herbicide-resistant weed populations in response to synthetic herbicide selective
pressure is threatening safe weed control practices achieved by these molecules. In Australia multiple-
resistant populations of annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) are effectively controlled by soil-applied
herbicides which provide adequate weed control.

<na> In this study we define the mechanistic basis of the experimentally-evolved resistance to the soil-applied
herbicide pyroxasulfone in a L. rigidum population. TLC and HPLC-MS provide biochemical
confirmation that pyroxasulfone resistance is metabolism-based with identification and quantification of
pyroxasulfone metabolites formed via a glutathione conjugation pathway in pyroxasulfone-resistant L.
rigidum plants.

<na> No field-evolved pyroxasulfone-resistant L. rigidum populations have thus
far been identified, however we experimentally evolved pyroxasulfone resistance in L. rigidum by
recurrent low-dose pyroxasulfone selection over a few generations (Busi et al., 2012) and showed cross-
resistance to the thiocarbamates prosulfocarb and triallate rapidly evolving in field collected populations
(Busi and Powles, 2013, 2016).

<na> The multiple resistant L. rigidum population SLR31 (hereinafter referred to as MR) evolved in the field
following extensive herbicide selection. MR plants exhibit multiple herbicide resistance to different
modes of action including the ACCase-inhibitor diclofop-methyl, the ALS-inhibitor chlorsulfuron
(Christopher et al., 1991), the mitosis inhibitor trifluralin (McAlister et al., 1995), and the VLCFAE
inhibitor S-metolachlor (Burnet et al., 1994).

<na> Herbicide survival response to pyroxasulfone in parental populations and F1 families grown in pots
Viable seeds of L. rigidum populations P6, MR, S were germinated on 0.6% (v/w) solidified agar and
planted into 2L pots containing commercial potting mixture (50% peatmoss, 25% sand and 25% pine
bark) when the primordial root was visibly erupting from the seed coat.

<na> The methodology for extraction and fractionation of pyroxasulfone metabolites following pyroxasulfone
treatment of L. rigidum plants is described in detail by Tanetani et al. (2013). In brief, following
pyroxasulfone hydroponic treatment, L. rigidum plants were weighed, roots washed with 20 ml of
acetonitrile and plants homogenized.

<na> For all the L. rigidum populations analysed in this study graphical data relative to the resistance
phenotype are presented as percent (%) of seed germination and seedling survival or gene expression
relative to population S set as equal to 1.

<na> From this dose-response study (experiment 2) 50 1-leaf
emerging seedlings 15 DAT were bulk collected for each resistant P6, MR and S L. rigidum population
and subjected to molecular analysis.

<na> The mechanistic basis for pyroxasulfone
327 resistance in the P6 resistant L. rigidum is metabolism-based with resistant plants displaying enhanced
328 capacity to detoxify pyroxasulfone via a glutathione conjugation pathway.

<q> What are the effects of Short-term HFD feeding in mice?

<a> These results show
that it takes 3-4 days of HFD feeding to cause glucose and insulin intolerance in mice. These
results also show that the percentage of dietary fat is directly related to the level of glucose and
insulin intolerance in mice.

<na> Conversely, antibiotics improved
glucose tolerance in mice with protracted obesity caused by long-term HFD feeding for over 2
months. We also found that microbiota transmissible glucose intolerance only occurred after
prolonged diet-induced dysbiosis.

<na> However, the mechanisms underpinning glucose
intolerance during the initial stages of HFD feeding are different than those governing chronic
glucose intolerance during prolonged HFD-induced obesity.

<na> Akkermansia was higher after 3 days of feeding a 45% HFD
(Fig. 2E). Many aspects of taxonomic changes observed on Day 3 of HFD feeding were
maintained at later time points of HFD feeding in mice (Fig. S2, S3).

<na> Therefore, short-term
HFD-induced effects on predicted genetic capacity for metabolism and environmental
information processing were opposite to those during long-term HFD feeding.

<na> These results show that the microbiota from long-term HFD feeding is sufficient
to promote glucose intolerance when chow-fed mice are exposed to this dysbiosis for over a
month (i.e. 45 days), but not for shorter duration such as 4 or 18 days.

<na> Diet is a key factor in the development of obesity and a dominant factor shaping the composition
of the microbiota. In mice, diet influences the composition of the gut microbiome more than host
genetics and it is already known that increasing dietary fat content can rapidly perturb the
composition of the microbiota within days.

<na> Glucose tolerance was not different after 1 or 2 days of HFD-feeding (Fig. 1A, S1A). Insulin
98 intolerance was evident after 3 days of feeding mice a 60% HFD, but not 3 days of 45% HFD
99 (Fig. S1B). Four days of HFD-feeding marked the first time that both 45% and 60% HFD caused
100 glucose intolerance compared to mice fed a chow diet (Fig. 1B).

<na> A single day of feeding either 45% or 60% HFD increased body mass compared to chow-fed
mice (Fig. 1E). Between 4-7 days of HFD-feeding, a 60% HFD caused a greater change in body
mass compared to a 45% HFD (Fig. 1E). A single day of feeding 60% HFD increased adiposity
(i.e. body fat percentage), whereas it took 3 days of feeding a 45% HFD to detect an increase in
whole body adiposity (Fig. 1F).

<na> The Bray-Curtis
similarity index of fecal bacterial DNA showed that the bacterial community was different in
chow fed mice (i.e. day 0), compared to mice fed a 45% or 60% HFD for 7 days (Fig. 2A, B).

<q> What is the function of Phage integrases?

<a> Phage integrases are responsible for catalyzing the site-specific recombination event that inserts the
phages into the hosts’ genome (36–41), as well as during replication to help in phage and plasmid
genome maintenance. A total of 18,352 prophages (43%) contained an integrase-like protein from one
of the two main families – the tyrosine and serine recombinases – named after the catalytic residue
involved in recombination.

<na> Temperate phage genomes are highly variable mosaic collections of genes that infect a bacterial host,
integrate into the host's genome or replicate as low copy number plasmids, and are regulated to switch
from the lysogenic to lytic cycles to generate new virions and escape their host.

<na> The integrase was routinely located at either end of the
integrated phage genome, and was used to orient and align prophage genomes to reveal their
underlying organization. The conserved genome alignments of phages recapitulate early, middle, and
late gene order in transcriptional control of phage genes, and demonstrate that gene order, presumably
selected by transcription timing and/or coordination among functional modules has been stably
conserved throughout phage evolution.

<na> Phages are major drivers in global biogeochemical cycles through the control they exert on bacterial
populations. Despite their abundance in the environment they are under-represented in sequence
databases and knowledge-bases.

<na> The phage
replicates in the host genome until external signals promote a transition to the lytic cycle, at which
point the phage hijacks the host’s cellular DNA replication machinery in order to replicate the phage
genome, and adopts the host’s protein synthesis machinery to create new phage particles. Eventually
the phage lyse releases infective particles to find new hosts to attack.

<na> Phages may mediate the spread of antibiotic resistance in the mammalian intestine (10), and
also transfer more benign genes such as those involved in photosynthesis (11).

<na> Identification of prophages in bacterial genomes is complicated by the problem that many
phage genes do not share sequence homology with other proteins. In some cases a newly discovered
phage does not carry any genes that share sequence similarity to any other gene in the available
databases, highlighting how little we know about these viruses (13).

<na> Most prophage identification algorithms rely on sequence similarity to
known phage genes to identify prophage regions (16–20). This leads to a paradoxical problem of not
being able to identify a prophage that does not contain any regions homologous to known phage
proteins.

<na> To compare the evolution of phage
and bacterial proteins, all 24,936 phage Int proteins were aligned in a pair-wise fashion using the
Smith-Waterman algorithm and the percent identity between each pair of proteins was calculated.
Bacterial taxonomy was taken from the NCBI taxonomy database (28).

<na> Shorter prophage genomes may indicate that the phage is no longer viable
and is in the process of being degraded or removed from the host’s genome (32). Alternatively,
different genome lengths may represent different packaging strategies used by prophages associated
with different phyla (33).

<q> Can VRK1 adobt P-loop folded conformation?

<a> We solved co-crystal structures of both VRK1 and VRK2
bound to BI-D1870 and of VRK1 bound to two broad-spectrum inhibitors. These
structures revealed that both VRKs can adopt a P-loop folded conformation, which is
stabilized by different mechanisms on each protein.

<na> The human genome encodes two active Vaccinia-related protein kinases (VRK),
VRK1 and VRK2. These proteins have been implicated in a number of cellular
processes and linked to a variety of tumors.

<na> VRK1 is a nuclear kinase implicated in cell cycle
control, chromatin condensation and transcription regulation, and its substrates
include p53, Activating Transcription Factor 2 (ATF2), Activator Protein 1
transcription factor (c-Jun), Barrier to Autointegration Factor (BANF1) and histone
H3 .

<na> The VRKs belong to the CK1 kinase group, whose members typically include
additional structural elements within the conserved kinase fold. Crystal structures are
available for the ligand-free kinase domains (KD) of VRK2 and VRK3.

<na> In addition to the catalytic domain, VRK1 and VRK2 have large, non-catalytic Cterminal
regions, which in VRK1 contains putative regulatory autophosphorylation
sites 26,27. The solution structure of VRK1 revealed that this region interacts with
residues from the protein ATP-binding pocket and activation segment.

<na> Ser/Thr
residues within this region are phosphorylated 10, an event that may be necessary for
the dissociation of the C-terminal domain from the ATP-binding pocket and
activation of VRK1. Much less is known about the structure of the C-terminal domain
of VRK2 and its impact on the kinase activity.

<na> Here we present the first crystal structures for the kinase domain of VRK1 and the
first crystal structures for ligand-bound VRK1 and VRK2. Our results reveal the
structural changes necessary for the displacement of VRK1 C-terminal region by
ATP-competitive inhibitors and suggest specificity determinants that may be
employed to design small-molecule inhibitors selective for the two active human
VRKs.

<na> Within the PKIS, VRK13-364 interacted mostly with broad spectrum compounds from
an oxindole series derived from a medicinal chemistry program targeting CDK2
inhibitors

<a> Thus, the folded conformation of the P-loop in VRK2 seems to
be driven mostly by shape complementarity and hydrophobic contacts between the
protein and the compound, whereas in VRK1 the P-loop folded conformation is held
in place by a direct interaction between the compound sulfur atom and the protein
aromatic residue.

<na> Our aim was to identify a strategy to generate VRK1- and VRK2-selective inhibitors
and our crystal structures reveal distinct structural features that may be explored to
this end.

<q> Does knockdown of PGC-1α activate Bcl-2 expression?

<a> Knockdown of PGC-1α activated Bcl-2
expression. Taken together, our results suggest that after serum depletion, PGC-1α
might coordinate with Bcl-2 to reduce ROS, which in turn delay cell cycle
progression.

<na> B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) has both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic potentials. It
is well known that Bcl-2 protein is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane,
and antagonizes with the pro-apoptotic protein BAX by forming Bcl-2/BAX
heterodimers that control mitochondrial membrane permeability and promote
tumorigenesis (Hockenbery et al., 1990).

<na> However, the signaling pathways by which Bcl-2 suppresses tumor
formation are not fully understood.

<na> We have recently observed that quiescent Bcl-2 overexpressing cells maintain
less mitochondrial ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) than control cells, elevation of
ROS accelerates cell cycle progression (unpublished data). These findings strongly
indicated that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) plays a key role in
the anti-proliferation function of Bcl-2.

<na> Furthermore, our recent findings uncovered that PGC-1α regulates the cell
cycle through ATP and ROS signals in fibroblast cells (Fu et al., 2016). Therefore, we
proposed that PGC-1α might translocate into mitochondria to coordinate with Bcl-2’s
tumor suppression functions through reducing ROS.

<na> In this study, we investigated the relationship between Bcl-2 and PGC-1α. We
first establish Bcl-2 stable overexpressing cells and the control cells, synchronize
them in G0/G1 phase using serum starvation (SS) or contact inhibition (CI), then
determine the effects of Bcl-2 over-expression or silencing on PGC-1α expression.

*<na> Similarly, Bcl-2 expression were detected in cells expressing high levels of PGC-1α
or after knockdown of PGC-1α. We found that PGC-1α positively correlates with
Bcl-2, Bcl-2 negatively responds to PGC-1α expression.

<na> Since PGC-1α was upregulated in Bcl-2 overexpressing cells (Fig. 1, 2), we
further investigated the effects of Bcl-2 knockdown on PGC-1α using glioma U251
cells, which have high Bcl-2 and PGC-1α endogenous expression.

<na> Three specific
siRNAs (506, 528, and 928) were used to interfere with Bcl-2 expression in U251
cells, while a GAPDH siRNA and a mimic siRNA were used as a positive control and
negative control (NC), respectively (Fig. 3A).

<na> . These
results demonstrated that PGC-1α expression was downregulated by Bcl-2 in a dose
dependent manner, suggesting the close link between PGC-1α and Bcl-2.

<q> what is the resolution of proteinase K structure?

<a> In summary, we have obtained the atomic resolution structure of proteinase K at
ambient temperature. The resolution of 1.20 Å was attained using ~82,000 indexed patterns
from SFX.

<a> In this report, we describe the
1.20 Å resolution structure of proteinase K using 13 keV photon energy. Hydrogen
atoms, water molecules, and a number of alternative side-chain conformations
have been resolved.

<a> Here we report the 1.20 Å resolution structure of proteinase K obtained at ambient
temperature. Proteinase K (EC 3.4.21.64) acts as a catalyst for hydrolysis (16,17) and
aminolysis (18,19).

<a> Although
the atomic resolution structure of proteinase K at 0.98 Å is known at cryogenic temperature, the
ambient temperature structure at a resolution greater than 1.5 Å has not been available (20).

<na> For SFX experiments, proteinase K from Engyodontium album (No.P2308, Sigma) was
crystalized by mixing a 1:1 ratio of 40 mg ml−1 protein solution in 20 mM MES–NaOH (pH 6.5)
and precipitant solution composed of 0.5 M NaNO3, 0.1 M CaCl2, 0.1 M MES–NaOH (pH 6.5).
Microcrystals (size 8–12 μm) were produced by incubation for 5-10 min at 18°C.

<na> The crystals of proteinase K were suspended in 1.0 ml of the
crystallization reagent. The crystal suspensions were filtered through a mesh (pore size, 30 μm).
The crystal number density was adjusted to 4.9 × 107 crystals/ml. The sample was stored at 18°C.

<na> A proteinase K crystal was placed in a cold nitrogen gas stream after a brief soaking in a
cryoprotectant solution: 30%(w/v) glycerol in the precipitant solution. X-ray diffraction images
were collected using an RAXIS-V area detector (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with synchrotron
radiation in the wavelength of 0.80 Å at the BL-26B1 station of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) (38).
The data obtained were processed, merged, and scaled using the HKL2000 program package
(39).

<na> The
coordinates and observed intensities of proteinase K have been deposited in the PDBj (accession
code 5kxu for SFX and 5kxv for SRX). The total absorbed dose was calculated by RADDOSE
(46). Details of data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 1.

<na> Protein structures at atomic resolution (beyond 1.20 Å) (1) can provide insights into the
delineation of active sites residues, substrate recognition sites, and catalytic mechanisms (2–5).
At such high resolution, the disposition and the protonation state of hydrogen atoms and a
number of water molecules can be resolved, which promotes our understanding of enzyme
functions directly linked to their structure (6–13).

<na> High brilliance X-ray and electron sources, sensitive detectors, and cryo-cooling
techniques have facilitated high-resolution structure determination. Yet the ultimate
wavelength-limited resolution can result in radiation induced structure deformation. The
radiation induced structural damage can be reduced by keeping the specimens at 100–110 K
during the measurements.

<q> How many mRNA structures are affected by heat shock?

<a> Genome-wide predictions of
the temperature dependence of mRNA structure
suggest that relatively few genes show a melting
transition between 30 °C and 42 °C, consistent with
our observations.

<na> We used
ribosome profiling to directly monitor translation in
E. coli at 30 °C and investigate how this changes
after 10-20 minutes of heat shock at 42 °C.

<na> Over a population of cells, mRNA
levels generally correlate with protein levels, but
there are large differences between individual
proteins (12, 14, 17). A clear example in
prokaryotes is the differential translation of
individual genes from polycistronic transcripts (12,
15).

<na> Ribosome profiling by deep sequencing
measures the distribution of translating ribosomes
within a cell’s transcriptome, and hence determines
how often a particular mRNA is translated (4, 5, 12).
A key parameter is translational efficiency (TE), the
rate of protein production per mRNA, which is
equivalent to the number of ribosomes that translate
a particular mRNA molecule.

<na> Here, we use ribosome profiling to directly
quantify the relationship between mRNA
abundance and ribosome occupancy at 30 °C and
under heat shock conditions (42 °C) in the wellstudied
model organism, E. coli K12 MG1655.

<na> For each sample, mRNA and ribosome
footprint cDNA libraries were prepared and
sequenced. The number of reads per gene was
calculated and normalized with EdgeR (23) to give
mRNA and footprint counts per kilobase million
(CPKM) for each gene.

<na> This observation is likely due to the replicates
having been grown on different days, whereas the
six samples for each replicate (mRNA and
footprints for 30 °C and for 10 and 20 minutes at
42 °C) were processed and sequenced together.

<na> The cold shock protein
CspA’s mRNA contains a motif that activates its
translation at low temperature (31). However, cspA
is strongly translated (TE of 4.6 ± 1.1 at 30 °C and
4.5 ± 0.77 after 10 minutes at 42 °C), suggesting that
this mechanism does not prevent translation under
these conditions.

<na> However, the RNA structure calculations
are not well constrained for such long molecules,
and these results may not be representative of the
mRNA structural ensembles in living cells.

<a> Most
genes have similar predicted melting curves, with a
large transition around 90 °C. Only a minority of
transitions occur between 30 °C and 42 °C, and
many of these transitions have small enthalpies
compared to the total folding free energy of the
gene’s mRNA.

<q> What is the VAT conformation in presence ot ADP?

<na> VAT, the
Thermoplasma acidophilum homologue of eukaryotic CDC48/p97, works in conjunction
with the proteasome to degrade misfolded or damaged proteins.

<na> Truncation of the first
182 residues of VAT removes the regulatory NTD, producing a construct (ΔN-VAT) that
has both higher ATPase and unfoldase activity than the intact protein 1–3. In solutions of
ΔN-VAT, the enzyme itself is degraded in an ATP- and proteasome-dependent manner
(Fig. 1a-c).

<a> Cryo-EM of full-length VAT previously showed that the enzyme adopts a helical splitring
conformation in the presence of ADP. ΔN-VAT particles with bound ADP
assemble into long fibrils (Fig. 1d), presumably comprised of helical split-ring structures
interacting with each other top-to-bottom.

<na> With the slowly-hydrolysable ATP-analogue
ATPγS bound, full-length VAT exists in both the split-ring conformation and a six-fold
symmetric stacked-ring conformation. Similarly, ΔN-VAT with bound ATPγS forms a
mixture of fibrils (Fig. 1e) as well as single particles, the majority of which appeared to
be six-fold symmetric (Fig. 1e, red circles).

<na> The fibrils could be excluded easily when
selecting single particle images for analysis, allowing calculation of a cryo-EM map of
the six-fold symmetric stacked-ring conformation of VAT at 3.9 Å resolution.

<na> Consequently, the six-fold symmetric stacked-ring state with ATPγS
bound and the split-ring state with ADP bound likely correspond to pre- and postunfolding
conformations of the enzyme. In the substrate-bound conformation, the seam
protomer is positioned such that it does not interact with the substrate.

<na> An atomic model could be built for the entire map (Fig. 2b),
including the linker region between NBD1 and NBD2 (Fig. 2c, left), and both NBD1 and
NBD2 have strong density for ATPγS in their nucleotide-binding pockets (Fig. 2c, right)
indicating that VAT adopts a rigid and symmetric conformation when fully loaded with
nucleotide.

<na> Unsupervised classification of ATPγS-loaded ΔN-VAT particle images using a new ab
initio 3D classification algorithm allowed identification of a second conformation of the
protein that was significantly different from known structures.

<na> The class corresponding to
this conformation, containing ~15 % of particle images, showed two ΔN-VAT complexes
in close apposition to one another (Fig. 3, Fig. 3 Supplement 1).

<na> The map shows clear density
for the substrate protein in an extended conformation as it runs almost directly through
the central pore of the active ΔN-VAT (Fig. 3a and b, red density).

<q> Is it possible to identify the RNA editing event at the proteome level?

<a> The work demonstrates the
feasibility to identify the RNA editing event at the proteome level using shotgun proteomics and
customized edited protein database.

<na> Tree deep proteome data sets for Canton-S fruit fly line
were used in the study: two taken from public repository and the third one obtained here for the
isolated brains. A customized protein sequence database was generated using results of genomewide
adenosine-to-inosine RNA studies in fruit fly and applied for identifying the edited
proteins.

<na> The main purpose of the study was identifying the RNA
editing events in the proteome followed by validation of selected edited peptides by targeted
mass spectrometry. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt to characterize RNA editing in
Drosophila at the proteome level. Tandem mass spectrometry data were taken from recent
shotgun proteomics studies (25, 26) available at ProteomeXchange.

<na> These results contain data for proteome of
Drosophila’s whole bodies (25) and whole heads (26). The other data set for Drosophila’s brain
proteome was obtained here using high-resolution mass spectrometry.

<na> The data from 3 proteomes were used for the RNA editing sites search. One proteome was
obtained experimentally here and the other two were taken from (25) and (26). A thorough
schematic explanation of the whole workflow performed is given in Figure 1.

<na> The flies had been transferred to a new tube as they reached the adult stage.
For general samples that were used for shotgun proteome analysis, as well as for the initial
targeted analysis, 200 flies were selected from the culture regardless of their age.

<na> These results contain data for proteome of Drosophila’s
whole bodies (25) and whole heads (26). The other data set for Drosophila’s brain proteome was
obtained here using high-resolution mass spectrometry. Note also that the proteome
characterized by Aradska et al. (26) contains only membrane proteins as they were intentionally
extracted during the sample preparation.

<na> Today, LC-MS/MS analysis using high-resolution mass spectrometry
provides deep proteome covering about 50% of human genome from a single sample (58, 59).
This ratio is even higher in model organisms, which may be characterized by more open
genomes with higher numbers of expressed proteins (60). Correspondingly, a next aim of
proteomics is to catalogue proteoforms of each protein, i.e. multiple protein species originated
from one gene (61, 62).

<na> In this study, we performed searches of three fruit fly proteome data sets against three
RNA editome databases. These searches have resulted in identification of 56 edited sites, 21 of
them being validated by identification in at least two data sets and/or by two search engines.
Also, the study included validation of two edited sites along with its unedited counterparts using
MRM assay.

<na> We
hypothesized here that the same approach with construction of customized databases for the
search in shotgun proteome would be useful to identify ADAR-mediated RNA editing events in
proteins.

<q> Which residues of AKAP-Lbc interact with PKM2?

<a> Mapping experiments
indicate that PKM2 directly interacts with amino acid residues 1923-2817 of
AKAP-Lbc. By disrupting the interaction between the two proteins with the
expression of the AKAP-Lbc fragments, our data suggest that the binding between
PKM2 and PKA plays a critical role in cell proliferation.

<na> Co-immunoprecipitation, pulldown and Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation
(BiFC) data indicate that PKM2 interacts with AKAP-Lbc.

<na> AKAP-Lbc (also known as AKAP13) is a scaffold protein that integrates signaling
through multiple enzymes including protein kinases A and D and the small G protein
Rho.

<na> To explore whether PKM2 and AKAP-Lbc interact in cancer biology, it is important
to confirm that both proteins are expressed in cancer cells. We chose several cancer
cell lines to examine the possibility. Firstly, we tested several commonly used cell
lines to detect the expression of both proteins.

<na> Flag-AKAP-Lbc was expressed in HeLa cells, and cell extract was incubated with
anti-Flag beads to pull down Flag-AKAP-Lbc and potential binding partners. We
found that Flag beads pull down both Flag-AKAP-Lbc and endogenous PKM2 in the
cell extract (Figure 2A).

<na> Consistent with the anti-Flag IP result, we observed that anti-AKAP-Lbc IP pulled
down both AKAP-Lbc and PKM2, while control IgG beads did not, indicating that the
two proteins interact in cancer cells.

<na> First, we expressed both Flag-AKAP-Lbc and HA-PKM2
fragments in HEK 293 cells, and then tried anti-Flag IP, then compared the amount of
HA-PKM2 fragments with the loading control equal to 10% of that used for IP.

<a> Furthermore, we deployed anti-GST IP to explore the
sequence of AKAP-Lbc which binds His-PKM2. In the assay, both GST-AKAP-Lbc
fragments and His-PKM2 from purified after expression in E. coli, and we found that
fragments 5 and 6, corresponding to AKAP-Lbc 1923-2366 and AKAP-Lbc
2337-2817, pulled down His-PKM2 (Figure 4B), suggesting the C-terminus of
AKAP-Lbc binds PKM2 directly.

<na> To
explore the possibility, we compared the effect of expressing Myc-AKAP-Lbc
fragments 1 and 6, and found that both fragments inhibited cell growth while
fragment 6 reduced cell proliferation more than fragment 1 (Figure 5B). Taken
together, disruption of the binding between AKA-Lbc and PKM2 reduces cell growth.

<na> Signaling, AKAP-Lbc may interact with PKM2. Working as a scaffold protein,
AKAP-Lbc provides a binding and interaction platform for other proteins or
complexes to play their specific role in specified space (Diviani, Soderling et al.
2001), therefore it is attractive to propose PKM2 may bind AKAP-Lbc to regulate cell
growth or proliferation or migration in cancer cells. To check the possibility, it is
necessary to confirm that they really bind each other, and fortunately we observed the
interaction.

<q> Can NgAgo cleave RNA?

<a> We show here that, unlike most other prokaryotic Argonaute (Ago) proteins, which are
DNA-guided endonucleases, the Natronobacterium gregoryi-derived Ago (NgAgo) can
function as a DNA-guided endoribonuclease, cleaving RNA, rather than DNA, in a
targeted manner.

<a> Recently, Gao et al. reported that the Ago homolog found in Natronobacterium gregoryi
(NgAgo) utilized 5’ phosphorylated small guide DNA molecules to recognize and cleave
double-stranded DNA in vitro and in human cell lines, enabling DNA-guided genome editing.

<na> Unfortunately, however, we and others failed to detect small insertions or deletions (indels)
at NgAgo target sites in human cells, mice, or zebrafish , bona fide evidence of genome
editing via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
in eukaryotic cells.

<na> First, we cloned the gene encoding NgAgo in an E. coli expression vector and purified the
recombinant NgAgo protein fused to a poly-histidine tag by metal affinity chromatography
(Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). The NgAgo protein was incubated
with a 5’-hydroxylated or 5’-phosphorylated gODN at 37 ℃ for 30 minutes to form Ago
deoxyribonucleoprotein (DNP) complexes.

<na> To the best of our knowledge,
no other eukaryotic or prokaryotic Ago proteins are guided by 5’-hydroxylated gODNs. A small
antisense RNA, the size and sequence of which was identical with those of the gODN, failed
to guide NgAgo to cleave the RNA target in vitro (Fig. 1a). Single-stranded and double-
stranded DNA molecules were not cleaved by the NgAgo DNP under our experimental
conditions.

<a> We next investigated whether metal ions were required for RNA cleavage by NgAgo. In
the presence of EDTA, a metal ion chelator, NgAgo failed to cleave the RNA target
(Supplementary Fig. 2a).

<a> To determine exact positions of RNA cleavage by
NgAgo, we cloned and sequenced RNA products after poly(A) tailing (Supplementary Fig. 3).
The RNA substrate was cut at several positions within a 22-nt gODN-complementary target
region. We also noted that NgAgo in complex with ≥ 30-nt gODNs initially yielded RNA
fragments distinct from those produced by NgAgo in complex with 20-nt gODNs (Fig. 1d).

<a> We also performed NgAgo reactions under multiple turnover conditions by incubating 0.03
μM NgAgo with 0.1 μM RNA substrate. NgAgo cleaved the RNA substrate completely in 16
hours (Supplementary Fig. 4). This result show that, unlike Cas9, a single-turnover enzyme18 93 ,
NgAgo is a multiple-turnover enzyme, cleaving its substrate repeatedly.

<na> In particular, NgAgo complexed with ODNs harboring mismatches in nt positions 5-14
(numbered from 5’ to 3’) were poorly active, suggesting that these positions constitute a “seed
region”. NgAgo tolerated mismatches at the 5’ and 3’ ends.

<na> Several recent reports claimed that NgAgo-DNA complexes achieved knockdown of the
green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene4, 13, 16 and endogenous genes15 107 in human cells and
zebrafish, respectively.

<q> Does Alp7R require DNA to nucleate filaments?

<a> Alp7R does not require DNA to nucleate filaments in vivo

<a> In this case though, filaments formed
with no possibility of DNA binding, consistent with our biophysical finding that Alp7R could
nucleate Alp7A filament formation independently of DNA in vitro.

<a> Finally, our in
vitro and in vivo experiments also reveal that Alp7R does not require DNA to nucleate and
stabilize Alp7A filaments.

<na> Although Alp7A does not form stable polymers at physiological concentrations, rapid nucleation
by an accessory factor, Alp7R, decreases the dynamic critical concentration into the
physiological range. Intrinsic and dynamic critical concentrations are fundamental parameters
that can be used to describe the behavior of all dynamically unstable polymers.

<na> The accessory factor, Alp7R, simultaneously accelerates Alp7A nucleation;
inhibits bundling; and partially stabilizes isolated filaments. The net result of these different
effects on polymer stability is to change the nature of the dynamic critical concentration from
being the point at which bundles form to being the point at which nucleation is fast enough to
outpace the rate of catastrophic filament loss.

<na> Derman et al. (2009) found that co-expression of Alp7R was required to observe dynamic Alp7A
polymer formation in B. subtilis cells. To understand the nature of this regulation, we purified
Alp7A and Alp7R and studied their interaction in vitro.

<na> Addition of 0.5 µM
Alp7R dramatically increased the rate at which 15µM Alp7A polymerized, and reduced the time
required to reach steady state to approximately 40 seconds (Figures 1A, red trace). Alp7R also
decreased the number of steps required to form a nucleus from four to one (Figure 1B, red
symbols), suggesting that it accelerates polymerization at least partly by accelerating nucleation.

<na> This biphasic effect on polymerization suggests that the activity of an Alp7R
dimer relies on its interaction with at least two Alp7A monomers. At high concentrations, Alp7R
dimers are less effective because they compete for a limited pool of Alp7A monomers.

<na> In addition to accelerating filament assembly, Alp7R also altered the architecture of Alp7A
polymers. By electron microscopy, Alp7A appears as ribbon-like bundles of two-stranded
filaments (Figure 2A), but addition of Alp7R reduced the size of Alp7A bundles in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2B).

<na> Addition of Alp7R further decreased the steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis by Alp7A in
this regime (Figure 4B), suggesting that Alp7R promotes polymer formation at these
concentrations, at least in part, by reducing the rate of disassembly of these ephemeral Alp7A
filaments.

<q> What is the assembly of purified RSV CA under physiological
conditions?

<a> In this study we demonstrate that incubation of purified RSV CA under physiological
conditions causes it to assemble into multi-layered tubes built from capsid hexamers, which
effectively model the surface of the mature capsid. We characterize some basic aspects of
the tube assembly process, and show that the spacer peptide acts as a layering determinant
during tube assembly, effectively blocking the multi-layering which otherwise completely
predominates.

<na> To promote
assembly, purified RSV CA (600-700 μM in standard neutral pH storage buffer) was dialyzed
against the same buffer, with variation of the NaCl concentration (25 - 1500 mM). Dialysis
was carried out at a fixed temperature of 37 °C. The figure shows transmission electron
micrographs of typical assembly products, negatively stained with uranyl acetate.

<a> In this work, we show that RSV CA assembles in vitro at
physiological temperatures, forming hexamer tubes that effectively model the mature capsid
surface.

<na> . Hence the
spacer peptide has often been considered irrelevant to mature capsid assembly. Despite this,
appending the spacer peptide to RSV CA has been shown to have functional consequences,
strongly promoting capsid assembly in in vitro assays.

<na> Linkage of RSV CA assembly to
temperature has not been previously recognized. Because of its obvious biological relevance,
we explored this temperature-dependent assembly in more detail. In our initial experiments
RSV CA solutions (600-700 μM) were dialyzed for 16-24 hours against neutral pH buffers
containing 25 - 1500 mM NaCl, at a temperature of 37 °C.

<na> Two firm conclusions can be drawn from these observational experiments. Firstly, assembly
of RSV CA is strongly promoted at physiological temperatures. Secondly, the particular
outcome of the assembly process is linked to the neutral salt concentration in the medium,
which can apparently shift the proportion of hexamers and pentamers that are formed.

<na> Tube formation appeared to be most efficient at sub-physiological salt
concentrations. As the salt concentration was raised above physiological levels, RSV CA still
assembled, but the outcome of the assembly process shifted. At 800 mM NaCl, a mixture of
tubes and Core-Like-Particles (CLPs) was observed, while at 1500 mM NaCl tubes were no
longer observed however CLPs and small spherical particles were abundant (Fig2B).

<na> Collectively,
the EM and light scattering results highlight the critical importance of charge screening effects
in regulating RSV CA assembly, which was previously inferred from the ability of polyatomic
anions like phosphate to promote in vitro assembly

<na> Assembly was strongly linked to protein concentration,
and there was clearly a threshold protein concentration below which assembly did not occur.
The existence of a critical protein concentration suggests that tube formation is a nucleated
process, in accord with simple theories of helical polymerization, and prior experimental
and theoretical studies of orthoretroviral CA assembly.

<na> However
the spacer peptide acts as a layering determinant during tube assembly. If only a minor
fraction of CA-SP is present, multi-layered tube formation is blocked, and single-layered
tubes predominate.

<q> Where encapsulins are found?

<a> This resulted in a
list of 909 encapsulins distributed in 15 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Data
1). Encapsulins can be found in anaerobic thermophilic microbes of the genera Thermotoga, Clostridium
(Bacteria) and Pyrococcus (Archaea) as well as aerobic mesophilic soil bacteria (e.g. Streptomyces and
Bacillus), cyanobacteria (e.g. Acaryochloris) and host-associated microbes, both commensal (e.g.
Bacteroidetes and Propionibacterium) and pathogenic (e.g. Mycobacterium, Escherichia and
Pseudomonas). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria harbor the largest number of encapsulin systems (47
and 27%, respectively) while encapsulins can also be found in many less explored phyla like the
Planctomycetes and Tectomicrobia.

<a> We identified more than 900 proteinaceous encapsulin
nanocompartment systems in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Encapsulins can be found in 15 bacterial
and 2 archaeal phyla.

<na> We experimentally characterize 3 newly identified encapsulin
systems and illustrate their involvement in iron mineralization, oxidative and nitrosative stress
resistance and anaerobic ammonium oxidation, a process responsible for 30% of the N lost from the
oceans. We propose that encapsulins represent a widespread strategy for toxic reaction sequestration in
prokaryotes.

<na> The key feature of encapsulin systems is that they specifically encapsulate cargo proteins, which
are targeted to the encapsulin capsid interior via small C-terminal peptide tags referred to as targeting
peptides (TPs) . So far, 7 encapsulin systems have been investigated.

<na> By surveying and analyzing the newly identified encapsulin gene clusters, we can
assess the potential for functional nanocompartment production in organisms occupying diverse
habitats ranging from anaerobic hyperthermophilic environments to the human host, and predict their
functions at the molecular level.

<na> The widespread distribution of encapsulin nanocompartments makes them one of the most
predominant classes of protein organelles. Our systematic approach identified 909 encapsulin systems
distributed in 15 bacterial and 2 archaeal phyla spanning a remarkable breadth of microbial diversity and
habitats. Initially, position-specific iterative (PSI)-BLAST searches using all experimentally confirmed
encapsulin capsid proteins were carried out against the NCBI database of non-redundant protein
sequences.

<na> The presence of multiple encapsulin systems within a single organism argues that each of
them conveys a distinct evolutionary benefit.

<na> We identify new cargo types and other encapsulin-associated components illustrating that encapsulin
systems are more complex than previously assumed. An encapsulin system is defined by the core
operon, composed of the encapsulin capsid and core cargo genes (Fig. 1B). All cargo proteins are
characterized by the presence of a targeting peptide (TP) at one of the termini.

<na> BLAST searches in the set of encapsulin-encoding genomes were carried out
using 3 different TP consensus sequences as queries. The first consensus sequence used was based on
the TPs of all core cargo types identified in this study. Using the core consensus we identified 76
secondary cargo proteins of 4 different types (Flp: 27, Peroxi: 8, Heme: 14 and Ferredoxin (Fer): 27), 3 of
them previously unknown (Peroxi, Heme and Fer) (Fig. 2A).

<na> . Besides core and
secondary cargo, non-targeted associated proteins are often found in the vicinity of encapsulin core
operons and are confined to specific genera and core cargo types.

<q> What was the absorbtion rate of the photosensitizer for A. flavus?

<a> As observed, A. flavus has a high of absorption rate of the photosensitizer.
Therefore, we looked after to know if crystal violet could somehow cause injuries to the
mycelium. We realized tests of viability in different variations of time, mediums and
conditions, as described in methodology. There was incubations with period of 6 hours
under resting and 18 hours under resting and agitation.

<na> The dishes containing solid medium and solution of spores were maintained at
30°C. During this time the solid medium absorbs both control and sample solutions
added.

<na> Under conditions of agitation
through 6 hours of growth, A. flavus absorbed 39% in SM and 13% in CZ, and 43.83%
under resting in SM medium. At last, through 18 hours of growth, under resting in SM
medium, the filamentous fungi absorbed only 30.03% of photosensitizer. The figure 4
below representes the data in a 15µM concentration of crystal violet.

<na> A hypothesis
suggests that due to the absence of salt in SM, the fungi is induced to search for any
kind of salt in the medium, finding only CV that is a cationic salt. It absorbed crystal
violet as a source of food in simple medium.

<na> The sample fungi did not
progressed with growth, demonstrating that there was photodynamic inactivation of
pathogenic fungi A. flavus. The studies of viability of fungi after incorporation of CV
and maintained in the dark showed that growth was equal both in samples and controls.

<na> Different conditions for incorporation of photosensitizer by A. flavus were
detected after 6 and 18 hours of incubation under resting and agitation conditions, in
simple medium and CZ medium.

<na> In the
assays of viability after excitation via laser, there was growth in all cultures. However,
when we analysed the biomass of fungi, there was a higher growth of control fungi in
relation to sample fungi, demonstrating that the photodynamic inactivation was
promoted.

<na> When fungi was inoculated from liquid simple medium to solid simple medium,
there was no growth of mycelium in both control and sample, as shown in figure 5.

<na> A hypothesis
suggests that due to the absence of salt in SM, the fungi is induced to search for any
kind of salt in the medium, finding only CV that is a cationic salt. It absorbed crystal
violet as a source of food in simple medium.

<na> When inoculated in solid CZ medium, fungi showed
growth in all triplicates of all concentrations of CV in both control and samples as
shown in figure 6. Therefore, we analysed the dry mass of mycelium as described in
methodology to determine if the photosensitizer had any effects to mycelium. The
results of dry mass in all three concentrations are shown in table 3 below.

<q> How many carbohydrate recognition domains has VIP36?

<a> VIP36 and ERGIC-53 contain a single carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The D1 arm of mannoses
linked to Asn-N-sequons was found to form extensive hydrogen bonds with VIP36 in the crystal
2DUR (Satoh et al 2007) and interestingly, the coordination of Ca2+ was found to orient the side
chains that had previously been speculated to be involved in carbohydrate and calcium binding based
on this similarity (Fiedler et al 1994), i.e. Asp131 and Asn166 as well as His190.

<na> Galectin-9 contains two CRDs and the N-terminal CRD was described to interact with polylactosamines
and some glycosphingolipid (GSL) headgroups (Hirabayashi et al 2002; Nagae et al 2008; Nagae
et al 2009; Mishra et al 2010). An activity as an eosinophil chemoattractant had also been discovered
(Sato et al 2002).

<na> Nagae M, Nishi N, Nakamura-Tsuruta S, et al (2008) Structural Analysis of the Human Galectin-9 Nterminal
Carbohydrate Recognition Domain Reveals Unexpected Properties that Differ from the
Mouse Orthologue. Journal of Molecular Biology 375:119–135.

<na> Regulated classes of molecules could also include the
sorting machinery of polarized epithelial cells, sorted ligands or both, that may be altered in cellular
transformation. I have analyzed here the cargo receptor VIP36 (Vesicular-integral membrane protein
of 36 kD) for carbohydrate interaction.

<na> High affinity binding of the ganglioside GM1 carbohydrate headgroup to VIP36 suggests a linkage
with protein and glycosphingolipid apical transfer in epithelial cells. Thus, this fundamental approach
with large scale docking of 165 carbohydrates including 19 N-glycan high mannose, 17 Nglycan
hybrid, 9 N-glycan complex, 17 O-glycan core, 27 Sialoside, 25 Fucoside and 51 other glycan
residues suggests, that linked cargo-receptor apical transport may provide a path to epithelial polarization
that may be modulated by core fucosylation.

<na> The present data may contribute
to shed light on the role of fucose in carbohydrate N-glycan binding of the L-type lectins and
possible indications of branch preference of GlcNAc-transferases with respect to apical sorting of
glycoproteins.

<na> An overview of a structural comparison is shown in Table 1. Galectins, although only up to
10% identical in amino acid sequence, show a similar fold to VIP36. The carbohydrate binding site is,
yet, removed from the site of ERGIC-53 and VIP36 glycan interaction.

<na> The ganglio series GM1 (IV) was one of few GSL motifs in the entire database Carb165 (depleted in
GSL residues). The GM1 headgroup is present, among other species, in Campylobacter jejuni as part
of an epitope widely studied in human disease of autoimmune disorders caused by these bacteria
(see Table S1).

<na> Further screening may later lead to precise determination of all glycosphingolipid
affinities and binding specificities including their frequent H-bond acceptors and donors that may
vary from other carbohydrate residues.

<na> Topology 3 shows the carbohydrate approaching the cavity from Tyr164 towards the
centre of the binding cavity, towards the bridge in between Asp131 and Gly260 (6 / 15).

<q> How quantify dependence between motif positions?

<a> Using the pLogo tool and an internal version of the motif-x program (19, 20), we
evaluated dependence between motif positions. It is important to note that while we identify
tryptic peptides by tandem mass spectrometry, the kinase-substrate interaction that produced
the phosphorylation event occurred in the context of full-length substrate proteins.

<a> This
can provide hundreds to thousands of kinase-specific phosphopeptides from which a
high-resolution motif model is generated. In this case, the motif model is a position weight matrix
with constant residues at one or more positions, which are easily visualized using the
pLogo (11) graphical representation.

<na> In agreement with previous studies (13, 14), DYRK1AWT 102 exhibited a
strong preference for proline in the P+1 position, and basic residues (particularly arginine) in the
upstream positions, which together form the optimal consensus sequence RxxS*P (Fig. 2C).

<na> We also
observed that while arginine remains a positive determinant in the upstream positions for all
DYRK1A variants (Fig. 3A to 3C, and Fig. S7A to S7C), the importance of this upstream region
increases slightly but not uniformly in the mutants (note the more significant P-2 arginine in
differential pLogos Fig. 3E and Fig. S7D, S7E, but not in Fig. 3D, Fig. 3F nor Fig. S7F).

<na> These results, along with previous work that traced evolutionary changes in substrate specificity
to amino acid substitutions (6), and the identification of potential specificity-determining
positions (7, 8), suggest that a thorough investigation of amino acid structure-function
relationships will be necessary to achieve a principled understanding of kinase specificity.

<na> There is also a
strong, previously unreported hydrophobic cluster present at P+2 for both serine and threonine
substrates. DYRK1A does not exhibit a significant phosphotyrosine motif (Fig. S4C), however
our 558 unique tyrosine phosphorylation sites in E. coli clearly indicate that DYRK1A is capable
of phosphorylating tyrosine substrates in trans, and that phosphotyrosine activity is not
restricted to autophosphorylation, as previously thought (13, 18).

<na> This pattern is
referred to as a kinase specificity motif (or simply “motif”), and is a model of substrates that are
compatible with the kinase’s substrate binding pocket and can thus be phosphorylated. Motifs
are primarily inferred from known physiological substrates (3), and are sometimes modeled as a
string of allowable residues, as a position weight matrix, or as a combination of these.

<na> Motifs
are primarily inferred from known physiological substrates (3), and are sometimes modeled as a
string of allowable residues, as a position weight matrix, or as a combination of these. The
presumed motif is a well-established starting point for in silico prediction of putative
substrates (4); however, for nearly all protein kinases, the numbers of known substrates are
very few in number resulting in poorly defined, low-resolution motif models.

<na> The kinase phosphorylates
bacterial proteins consistent with its endogenous kinase specificity motif. The extremely low
activity of serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases and phosphatases in E. coli (10) allows for a high
signal-to-noise ratio, and the absence of confounding human kinase cascades ensures a direct
link between expressed kinase and observed phosphorylation event.

<na> DYRK1A does not exhibit a significant phosphotyrosine motif (Fig. S4C), however
our 558 unique tyrosine phosphorylation sites in E. coli clearly indicate that DYRK1A is capable
of phosphorylating tyrosine substrates in trans, and that phosphotyrosine activity is not
restricted to autophosphorylation, as previously thought (13, 18).

<q> Can we label talin with Qdot-Abs?

<a> Neither a nuclear protein (SC35), nor an antigen
within a large complex (talin) could be labelled with the Qdot-Abs. Our current
explanation for these results is that the specificity of Qdot-Abs is dependent upon the
type of protein and its location within the cell.

<na> Qdots with
a single wavelength. In spite of these attractive properties, their take up by biologists
has been somewhat limited and only a few Qdot conjugates are commercially
available for the labelling of cellular targets.

<na> Antigens were labelled simultaneously
with a fluorescent dye coupled to a secondary antibody (Dye-Ab) and the Qdot-Ab.
Although, the Dye-Ab labelled all of the intended target proteins, the Qdot-Ab only
bound to some of the protein targets in the cytosol and could not reach the nucleus
even after extensive cell permeabilisation.

<na> There are some notable examples of Qdot-Abs in the published literature, to label
glycine receptors [22], glial fibrillary acidic proteins (GFAPs) [12], mortalin [23],
erythrocytes [24], GRP78 protein [25], caveolin-1 [26], golgi [20], and nuclear HER2
targets [6].

<na> Another concern amongst users of commercial
Qdot-Abs is non-specific labelling and the formation of aggregates, which may
introduce artifacts and lead to misinterpretation of false positive results [12, 13].

<na> To eliminate the possibility of competition between the Dye-Abs and
Qdot-Abs, for the antigen binding sites, which could affect the labelling, samples were
also prepared separately with either a Dye-Ab or Qdot-Ab. A Qdot 625 concentration
of 20 nM was used, as it has been shown that a high concentration of Qdot-Abs
improves specific labelling and signal-to-noise ratio [21].

<na> The vast majority of studies using Qdots show tubulin
staining [6, 12, 16, 18, 20], therefore we sought to label this abundant cytosolic protein
in order to have a positive control for our labelling protocol.

<na> To investigate whether the same structure (microtubules) could be labelled with a
different antigen, direct ICC was performed using a Qdot 625 conjugated directly to an
anti-GFP primary antibody (see Methods for details).

<na> Using the same
primary antibody, both Alexa Fluor 488 and Qdot 625 labelled the cytosolic pool of
talin (Figure 3). Interestingly however, the bound pool forming focal adhesions were
only visible when labelled with Alexa Fluor 488, and not Qdot 625 (Figure 3).

<na> We therefore looked to
antigens present in more complex intracellular structures, including the focal adhesion
protein talin and nuclear splicer marker SC35.

<q> What is the most often used method for global metabolome profiling?

<a> Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a prevalent method for
global metabolome profiling . Combining nanoscale LC with high-resolution MS leads to the
detection of thousands of high-confidence metabolite features in a complex sample . Numerous
software programs have been developed for processing large-scale datasets .

<na> JUMPm
determines the chemical formulas of metabolites from unlabeled and stable-isotope labeled
metabolome data, and derives the most likely metabolite identity by searching structure
databases. JUMPm also estimates the false discovery rate (FDR) with a target-decoy strategy
based on the octet rule of chemistry.

<na> The human metabolome1 45 contains conventional
cellular metabolites along with other chemicals derived from food, microbiota, and the
environment. The role of the metabolome has been increasingly appreciated in both development
and disease.

<na> To address the limitations of spectral library searches and false discovery analysis, we
propose a formula-based strategy for identifying metabolites, metabolome identification by
systematic stable isotope labeling experiments (MISSILE), as well as a new program (JUMPm)
for automated data analysis and false discovery evaluation.

<na> We aim to unambiguously determine the chemical formula of a precursor ion and then search its
MS/MS spectra against the metabolome database to identify candidate structures. To simulate
this process, we searched the known masses of all unique formulas in the human metabolome
database1 88 (HMBD, n = 8,255 up to 1,250 Da, Figure 1a) against a theoretical database of
formulas (n = ~265,000,000, Online Methods).

<na> To explore the MISSILE/JUMPm pipeline for global metabolite identification, we carried out a
comprehensive analysis of the yeast metabolome. First we characterized the labeling efficiency
of the MISSILE strategy in yeast.

<na> Coverage is a critical issue for large-scale metabolome analyses. The number of identified
metabolites will be affected by analytical coverage i.e., how many peaks are detected by LCMS,
and by bioinformatic coverage i.e., and by how many authentic peaks are detected and annotated
by JUMPm.

<na> We extended the method to mammalian cells with direct isotope labeling and
by heavy yeast spike-in. This strategy and algorithm provide a powerful a practical solution for
global identification of metabolites with a critical measure of confidence.

<na> Despite considerable progress in the development of software programs, identification of
metabolites from untargeted studies remains a daunting task. One major limitation is that spectral
libraries must be generated with synthetic standards.

<na> In contrast, when we searched the authentic dataset (non-random input) (Figure 3d, solid
line), there was a clear preference for the target database with an FDR of 10%, indicating that
the pairing score algorithm accurately detected real isotope labels corresponding to real
metabolite structures. For the authentic dataset, formulas with higher Pscores tended to have a
lower FDR, suggesting a negative correlation between the Pscore and FDR (Supplementary Fig.
12b).

<q> Are CYP51 soluble?

<a> Bacterial CYP51 proteins are also soluble, whereas fungal
CYP51 is instead an integrated membrane protein.

<na> Mutations in the target gene of azole anti-fungal drugs, cyp51a, have
been shown to confer resistance phenotypes in A. fumigatus [7, 8, 9]. cyp51a
encodes a CYP450-dependent enzyme, 14α-lanosterol demethylase, which is
inhibited when azole drugs bind to the catalytic iron of the heme prosthetic
group in the CYP51A active site.

<na> Structural and biochemical characterisation of fungal CYP51 is difficult
due to being an embedded membrane protein. Previous studies have used
crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CYP51 [11] (MT-CYP51 )[12,
13] and non-fungal eukaryotic species [14], with low sequence similarity to
fungal CYP51 [15].

<na> The A. fumigatus protein CYP51B (AfCYP51B) has 59% amino similarity
with its paralog, CYP51A (AfCYP51A), with the X-ray crystal structure
for AfCYP51B published in 2015 [17].

<na> The previous computational studies had excluded the complex
micro-environment of AfCYP51A, notably, the N-terminal anchored across
a lipid membrane bilayer.

<na> Since that study, the crystal structures 4UYL and 4UYM of CYP51B
from A. fumigatus have been made available, resulting in the additional sequence
identity captured in this study.

<na> Structural analysis of the L98H mutant and a comparison to the wild-type
was performed using the last 25 ns of each respective production run, from
which, the coordinates and velocities of each system at 5 ns intervals were
obtained for visual inspection.

<na> During the 25 ns of the wild-type simulation, N125 and C123 were
consistently beyond inter-atomic bonding. This came of little surprise given
the hydrophobic mismatch between the functional group of cysteine and asparagine
with the aliphatic side chain of leucine.

<na> The L98H substitution, far from the active site, clearly demonstrates a modification
to the structural configuration of the neighbouring residues. From
a visual inspection of the secondary structure arrangement, a change in side
chain hydrophobicity, from non-polar to polar-charged, resulted in a contraction
of the protein.

<na> The guanidinium functional group of R369
was shown to coordinate with a set of hydrogen bonds to the oxygen atoms
of the heme prosthetic group, during the first 10 ns. This coordination is
lost after the final 15 ns.

<q> Are salt bridges present in CARDs?

<a> Eight of the sixteen structures analysed possess a salt bridge between an aspartate or glutamate on
Helix 2 and a  lysine or arginine in the 4‐5 loop (Figure 6A, B). The alignment in Figure 5 shows that a
further 12 CARDs contain appropriately charged residues in these positions, suggesting that 20 of
the human CARDs maintain this salt bridge.

<na> Conserved hydrophobic residues are shown in red
and cover positions h8, h9 and h10. (B) Superposition of the eight CARD structures from the
alignment in pane (A) with their salt bridges coloured.

<na> It is plausible that these salt bridges may be important structurally and functionally. Certainly their
potential formation needs to be considered when producing homology models and in the
interpretation of site‐directed mutagenesis data.

<na> We have taken all known human caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a subfamily of the Death
Domain superfamily, and generated a structure‐guided sequence alignment.

<na> In order to provide a framework by which we can better understand
the functional diversity of the CARD we generated a structure‐based alignment of all known human
CARDs.

<na> By performing PSI‐BLAST
and jackhmmer searches with each of thes unique sequences we expanded the collection of human
CARDs to 36 through the addition of BINCA, CIITA, DLG5, MAVS, MDA‐5 CARD1, NLRC3, RIG‐I CARD1,
RIG‐I CARD2 and TNFRSF21 (Supplementary  Table  1).

<na> These elements were broadly similar to those seen in the two CARDs of RIG‐I (PDB:  4P4H)
except that in these instances the helix 2 deletion was only two residues long and the insertion in
the H3‐H4 loop for the first RIG‐I CARD only contained two residues.

<na> In total 17 different CARDs were used to generate a structure‐guided alignment of the human CARD
repertoire (Supplementary Figure 1). Aside from the absence of helix_6 in RIPK2 and NOL3 discussed
above the hydrophobic core residues were conserved with the exception of residue h4.

<na> The majority of CARDs aligned well and could be fitted so that any insertions and deletions were
placed outside of the likely helix positions while still fulfilling the requirement to create a
hydrophobic core.

<a> Almost all human CARDs were predicted to
contain a set of fourteen hydrophobic residues and half of these also maintain a surface salt bridge.

<q> Can lamellipodium work as ?

<a> Together these results suggest that the lamellipodium acts as a myosin independent
mechanosensor, applying force to bound integrins via actin polymerization driven
retrograde flow. On soft substrates, the increased pliability of the matrix leads to a
reduced load on the integrin-ECM bond, resulting in a shorter lifetime.

<na> Furthermore, we demonstrate that, contrary to
established assumptions, this property is independent of myosin II activity. Rather, we
find that cell spreading on soft substrates is inhibited due to reduced nascent adhesion
formation within the lamellipodium.

<a> Together these results suggest that
myosin II-independent forces in the lamellipodium are responsible for mechanosensation
by regulating new adhesion assembly, which in turn, directly controls cell spreading.

<a> Together
these results illustrate that nascent adhesion formation in the lamellipodium functions as
a myosin-II-independent mechanosensor to control cell adhesion and spreading.

<na> These data indicate that substrate
stiffness affects the stability of leading edge protrusions, but not the protrusion dynamics
themselves. Arp2/3 mediated lamellipodium formation is still required for spreading, as
cells on both soft and stiff substrates that are treated with CK-869, an Arp2/3 inhibitor,
are indistinguishable from control cells on soft substrates (Fig. 2F,G).

<na> On both soft
and stiff substrates p34 localizes to the cell periphery, indicative of the Arp2/3-dependent
lamellipodium (Fig. 3A,B). On stiff substrates, paxillin forms small punctate nascent
adhesions near the leading edge, which is characteristic of nascent adhesion formation
on glass substrates (42).

<na> Integrins bound to actin undergo retrograde flow, as is seen in the lamellipodium
(44), while unbound integrins are free to diffuse on the surface (45). When an integrin
comes in close proximity of a free fibronectin, it establishes a harmonic potential
interaction, which mimics binding, with the stiffness determined by substrate rigidity.

<na> Collectively these results illustrate that rigidity sensing in the lamellipodium is determined
by catch-bond kinetics of integrin-fibronectin bonds, and that the fraction of bound
integrins is sensitive to both the unloaded lifetime and the maximum lifetime of the catchbond
curve.

<na> To investigate the mechanisms that drive substrate stiffness sensing, we chose to
measure the spread area of adherent cells. We first plated NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on a series
of polyacrylamide gels covalently coupled with fibronectin, and with Young’s moduli
ranging from 0.6 to 150 kPa (Fig. 1A). Cells were also plated on glass absorbed with
fibronectin as a control.

<na> Cells on soft substrates are more rounded with
disorganized actin cytoskeletons (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cells on stiff substrates exhibit
more polarized shapes, and tend to have prominent stress fibers (Fig. 1B).

<q> Does AlfA resemble all other actins structurally?

<a> AlfA is different from all other actins in two critical
ways: it binds to ATP in a unique way, and it is missing a quarter of the conserved structural
core. These differences explain unusual AlfA assembly dynamics that underlie its ability to move
plasmids.

<a> The bacterial
actin AlfA segregates plasmids by a mechanism distinct from other partition systems, dependent
on its unique dynamic properties. Here, we report the near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structure
of the AlfA filament, which reveals a strikingly divergent filament architecture resulting from the
loss of a subdomain conserved in all other actins and a novel mode of ATP binding.

<na> The filament structure of the bacterial actin AlfA, which positions
plasmids - small, circular DNA molecules that encode important genes - to ensure that each
daughter cell receives a copy at cell division.

<na> The plasmid segregating actin AlfA, encoded by the Bacillus subtilis plasmid pLS32, was initially
identified as an actin on the basis of the five conserved actin motifs, and like other actins AlfA
forms ATP-dependent filaments both in vivo and in vitro(9, 13).

<na> . AlfA filaments associate laterally
into mixed polarity bundles, and extension of plasmid-bound filaments along bundles provides
the mechanism of plasmid segregation.

<a> Here, we report the structure of AlfA filaments determined by cryo-EM at near-atomic resolution,
which reveals the basis for its unique structural and functional characteristics. We show that
AlfA lacks the canonical actin subdomain IIb, which plays important structural and functional
roles in all other actins.

<na> While AlfA was clearly identified as an actin on the basis of the five conserved actin
motifs(13), sequence alignment of regions outside these motifs can be challenging due to the
very low level of sequence identity.

<na> To answer these questions we determined the
structure of the AlfA filament using cryo-EM.

<na> At physiological salt concentrations AlfA filaments spontaneously
assemble into bundles of variable thickness that are not well suited to high-resolution structure
determination. However, bundles can be dissociated into single two-stranded filaments at high
salt concentrations(9).

<na> We assembled the non-bundling AlfA mutant with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP,
and determined the structure of the filaments at 4.2 Å resolution by cryo-EM (Fig. 2, Fig. S4).
The refined helical symmetry of the two-stranded filament was 157.7° rotation and 24.4 Å rise
per subunit, giving a repeat distance of 394 Å (Fig. 2A).

<q> What NMR approach was used to study catalysis?

<a> For a quantitative understanding of the mechanism underlying the increased catalysis along the
directed evolution trajectory, we applied a powerful NMR method for studying systems in slow
exchange, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) spectroscopy.

<na> We show both kinetically, using NMR spectroscopy, and structurally,
by room-temperature X-ray crystallography, how local perturbations propagate through a large
allosteric network to facilitate conformational dynamics. The increased catalysis selected for in
the evolutionary screen could be rationalized entirely by accelerated interconversion between the
two catalytically essential conformational sub-states, which are both captured in the high-
resolution X-ray ensembles at room temperature.

<na> he overlay of
NMR spectra shows that the overall structure of all CypA forms is very similar, with perturbations
observed for residues close to the mutation site or in the dynamic network (Extended Data Fig. 1).

<na> To determine whether the rescue in catalysis is due to faster protein motion, we performed NMR
dynamics experiments on the S99T, S99T/C115S and S99T/C115S/I97V mutants (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Data 1-6). Previous NMR CPMG dispersion experiments suggested a direct link
between the speed of a conformational change in a dynamic network, labeled group-I, for both
wild-type (WT) and S99T CypA (Fig. 2a, red).

<na> NMR relaxation experiments enable us to “see” the prevalence of exchange on different time scales
and to unravel their importance in biological processes4 160 . The remarkable correspondence between
kmajàmin and kcat/KM (Fig. 3a) corroborates our hypothesis that the increased dynamics of group-I
residues is indeed responsible for the rescue in enzymatic activity.

<na> Quantitative analysis of fast and slow protein dynamics of CypA S99T
during catalysis of Suc-AFPF-pNA peptide (grey sticks) measured by NMR. CPMG relaxation
dispersion experiments revealed, similarly as in apo S99T, fast motion mainly in the flexible loop
(blue) and a slow process (red) consistent with the CEST data (spheres).

<na> swap of the major/minor states from WT to
S99T/C115S/I97V is observed for the group-I residues, thereby directly delivering the atomic
structures of the conformations for which we measured their interconversion rate by NMR.

<na> These structural
results, together with the characterization of collective dynamics by NMR, reveal how the
mutations selected by directed evolution have rewired the internal packing to increase the
dynamics of Phe113 correlated with surrounding group-I residues during the catalytic cycle.

<na> This highlights the importance of NMR dynamics measurements and
their quantitative comparison to corresponding changes in catalytic rates, which cannot be
extracted from an ensemble-averaged NOE-based structure calculation.

<na> NMR spectroscopy directly reveals how the kinetics of these transitions between alternative
internal packing arrangements controls the increased catalytic activity accumulated during directed
evolution.

<q> Where can explain the distribution of Polycomb marks?

<a> Strikingly, we show that GBM can explain the full distribution
of Polycomb marks in a whole Drosophila chromosome. Our model provides a
starting point for an understanding of the biophysics of cellular differentiation and
reprogramming.

<na> These findings can be readily
explained within our model if the 3D attraction between
polycomb marks is slightly weaker than that between,
e.g., H3K9me3-modified regions (Fig. 5).

<na> The
“Potts” recolouring scheme models recolouring of the segments
by computing the e↵ective change in energy after a
recolouring move (as explained below) and therefore it is
a “many-to-one” type of reaction.

<a> Chromosome-wide simulations employing PolycombResponse-Elements
as examples of GBM recapitulate
the distribution of H3K27me3 marks seen in
Drosophila cells.

<na> Within this
framework, the possible “epigenetic phases” of the system
are either disordered – no macroscopic epigenetic domain is
formed – or homogeneous – only one histone mark spreads
over the whole chromosome [44] (see Fig. 2).

<na> The
remaining 20% of the polymer is left blank and these “unmarked”
beads are allowed to dynamically change their
chromatin state into heterochromatin (blue) or polycomb
(purple) according to our recolouring scheme.

<na> We evolve the system to steady state and we evaluate
the probability of finding a Polycomb mark at a certain
genomic position [80]. This provides us with an in silico
ChIP-seq track for polycomb marks which can be compared
with in vivo ChIP-Seq data [58] (see Fig. 6B).

<na> These findings can be readily
explained within our model if the 3D attraction between
polycomb marks is slightly weaker than that between,
e.g., H3K9me3-modified regions (Fig. 5).

<na> Within our framework, architectural elements such as
CTCF [2], Cohesins [61] and SAF-A [72] may provide
the initial 3D chromatin conformation upon which the
GBM-driven establishment of epigenetic landscape takes
place [11, 40, 43].

<na> Here, we propose a new biophysical mechanism that can establish and maintain robust
yet plastic epigenetic domains via genomic bookmarking (GBM).

<q> Can CD spectroscopy provide atomic level details of a G-quadruplex?

<a> Although CD spectroscopy cannot provide atomic level details of a G-quadruplex, the
methodology described here represents a rapid and powerful tool to obtain quantitative
secondary structural and topological information for a G-quadruplex in solution from its CD
spectrum.

<na> A curated library of circular dichroism spectra of 23 G-quadruplexes of known structure was built
and analyzed. The goal of this study was to use this reference library to develop an algorithm to
derive quantitative estimates of the secondary structure content of quadruplexes from their
experimental CD spectra.

<na> Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a primary tool for the characterization of Gquadruplex
(G4) structures. G-quadruplexes are functionally important genomic elements that
form at specific locations in an orchestrated manner throughout the cell cycle.

<na> We used PCA and cluster analysis as an unbiased quantitative classification method to
reduce any ambiguity in the assignment of a CD spectrum to a G-quadruplex conformational
group to improve upon previously used semi-empirical and visual approaches.

<na> In order to develop such an analytical approach, it is
necessary to define the secondary structural elementsthat make a significant contribution to the
CD signal of a G-quadruplex, then to determine their underlying basis spectra by some analytical
approach. For this purpose, we used singular value decomposition (SVD) and least square fitting
to obtain structural information.

<na> To evaluate the accuracy of the prediction for each G-quadruplex CD spectrum, a leaveone-out
cross-validation using different random initial guesses of secondary structural fractions
was performed with a custom program (see supporting information).

<na> This method can determine the secondary base step composition (anti-anti, syn-anti,
anti-syn, loops) and the topologies (parallel, hybrid and anti-parallel) of G-quadruplex with
accuracy. As far as we know, this is the first study showing that such detailed quantitative
structural information of G-quadruplexes can be obtained by CD spectroscopy.

<na> CD spectroscopy is widely used for the quantitative determination of the secondary
structural content of proteins. Over several decades, reference libraries assembled for this
purpose have grown in content and a number of analytical algorithms have evolved that now
make the quantitative analysis of protein spectra by CD fairly routine.

<na> While some exceptions to these rules have been noted, they are generally
accepted for the characterization and validation of quadruplex formation in potential quadruplex
forming sequences.

<na> The goal of this study is to develop such
an analytical approach to provide quantitative secondary structural information about
quadruplexes from their measured CD spectra.

<q> Do precipitated mineral crystals occur on the bacterial cell wall?

<a> The saturation
rate of carbonate ions concentration (CO32−) is controlled by the first three parameters and it is
believed that bacterial cell wall as the nucleation site facilitate the stable and continuous calcium
carbonate deposition.

<na> It has been suggested that the bacterial cell walls can serve as nucleation sites as bacterial
cell surfaces carry negatively charged groups at neutral pH.

<a> Definitive proofs of involvement of bacterial cell walls in complex environments
on the nucleation process are rare. Ghashghaei and Emtiazi reported the presence of nanocrystals
of calcium carbonate on cell walls of the bacteria E. ludwigii for experiments performed with a
liquid culture.

<na> We investigate the morphology of precipitated crystals and conclusively demonstrate that
the presence of nano-crystals of calcite on the bacterial cell wall. While this can be considered as
definitive evidence that the cell wall does serve as a nucleation site, other mechanisms of
nucleation are not ruled out.

<a> Our platform allows
for in-situ visualization of the phenomena, and we found clear evidence of bacterial cell surface
facilitating formation of nanoscale crystals.

<na> The bacteria-free enzyme solution was compared to the
bacteria induced environment. Authors reported significant positive effect of bacterial presence
(referred as “bacteria-inclusive”) on the increase of size and growth rate of the precipitated
crystal though the idea of bacterial control of MICP was rejected.

<na> The primary advantage of the agar-column experimental setup is in-situ
visualization and easy access for supporting characterizations. The agar column was section at a
depth of 2.5 cm after a period of 7 days and crystalline depositions were characterized by other
forms of microscopy.

<na> This signal is likely due to the added NaCl in the bacterial growth
media. The transparent agar column therefore provided a real time monitoring platform to study
S. pasteurii induced calcium carbonate precipitation. The optical and elemental confirmation of
the precipitate provides an experimental support to the mineral deposition phenomenon induced
by bacteria.

<na> There has been significant interest in
microorganisms that can produce urease (urea amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.5) and hence are able to
hydrolyze urea to induce calcite precipitation.

<na> The primary advantage of the agar-column experimental setup is in-situ
visualization and easy access for supporting characterizations. The agar column was section at a
depth of 2.5 cm after a period of 7 days and crystalline depositions were characterized by other
forms of microscopy. Specifically, the agar colunm was characterized using optical microsopy,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area diffraction pattern (SAED) and elemental
characteization was determined by powder XRD and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS).

<q> What is a kinesin ATP consumption rate during a walk?

<a> Kinesin walks processively on microtubules (MTs) in an asymmetric
hand-over-hand manner consuming one ATP molecule per 16 nm
step.

<a> It is now firmly established, thanks to a number of high
precision experiments, that kinesin with two motor domains
walks in a hand-over-hand manner (5–8), by consuming one
ATP molecule per step (9).

<na> We use molecular simulations
by creating a new coarse-grained model of the microtubulekinesin
complex, which reproduces the measured stall force as well
as the force required to dislodge the motor head from the MT, to
show that nearly three quarters of the step occurs by bidirectional
stochastic motion of the TH.

<na> A remarkable series of experimental studies (3, 6, 15–17)
from a number of groups has revealed many of the details of
the stepping mechanism of kinesin.

<na> An optical
trap experiment (21) shows that a kinesin mutant, which lacks
the cover strand (a major docking site of the NL), can still
walk processively but generates much less force. It can, therefore,
be concluded that neck linker docking must contribute
significantly to force generation.

<na> However, the observation that the mutant
lacking cover strand walks processively indicates that kinesin
could walk by a Brownian ratchet mechanism in the absence
of external load.

<na> The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive (3, 23, 24).
Therefore, an unresolved question is what fraction of the
kinesin step is associated with power stroke and diffusion, respectively
(3, 25)?

<na> However, if the kinesin step is largely diffusive, what
keeps the motor on a single protofilament of the microtubule
(26–28), which contains multiple protofilaments?

<na> In order to distinguish between the predictions of these two
(extreme) models the motion of the kinesin motor head has
to be tracked at a microsecond temporal resolution. Despite
spectacular advances in using microscopy methods (see for
example (22)) to visualize the stepping kinetics of motors, the
needed time resolution to unambiguously track the position
of the stepping motor has not been reached.

<na> However, due to difficulties in tracking kinesin
experimentally at microsecond resolution (3), the importance
of diffusivity of the kinesin step has been stressed (3, 18) but
not been quantified.

<q> Can IRF3 induce expression of antiviral genes?

<a> In addition to their role in induction of IFNB1, transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 have been
shown to directly induce expression of some antiviral genes.

<na> For
example, components of the RIG-I signaling pathway, such as RIG-I, MDA5 and TRIM25 are
expressed at higher levels in the IFN-b expressing cells 22, and the fraction of IFN-b producing
cells increased when RIG-I signaling pathway components such as RIG-I, TRIM25, NF-kB,
IRF3 and IRF7 were overexpressed in cells prior to viral infection.

<na> To test their roles in expression
of the early ISGs, we immunofluorescently labeled IRF3 in SeV-infected cells, and analyzed the
time-course of its nuclear translocation, which is required for its transcriptional activation role.
We observed nuclear localization of IRF3 in 6 %, 25 % and 64% of the cells at 3, 6 and 9 hpi
respectively, which is similar to that of RIG-I induction (Fig. 3D, E, Fig. 2B).

<na> These results together indicate that early ISGs expression is dependent on
IRF3 or IRF7.

<na> The heterogeneity in IFNB1 response has previously been shown to be relieved by increasing the
concentration of various components of the pathway, such as RIG-I, TRIM25, IRF3, IRF7 and
NF-kB to non-physiological levels.

<na> Finally, we still observe a fraction of IFNB1 non-expressing cells showing high expression of
early ISGs. Therefore, in addition to the expression of IRF3/7 dependent RIG-I and MDA5,
there must be additional steps required for IFNB1 induction, for example promoter binding and
interchromosomal associations, providing further means of fine tuning the signaling process.

<na> Plasmid transfected cells were grown for 9 to 12 hours before viral infection.
siRNAs targeting IRF3 (sc-35710) and IRF7 (sc-38011) were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. 30 pmol of each siRNA was transfected at a final concentration of ~45 nM, using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) transfection reagent. Cells transfected with siRNA were
grown for 30 hours before viral infection.

<na> Antibodies for IRF3 and
NF-kB were obtained from Cell Signaling (11904P) and Abcam (ab119826) respectively. Whole
procedure was performed at room temperature. Immunofluorescence images were obtained using
Zeiss LSM 710 confocal scanning microscope equipped with a 40x oil-immersion objective (NA
1.3).

<na> As RLRs are major players in viral recognition and subsequent IFN induction, and have been
implicated in the heterogeneous expression of IFNB1, single-cell measurements with high
precision and sensitivity are needed to more accurately understand their expression kinetics and
functional consequences in antiviral signaling.

<na> To confirm that virus-induced early expression of RIG-I is indeed independent of IFN, first, we
employed Vero cells that cannot produce any type of IFN due to genetic defects, but do have
IFNAR and an intact JAK-STAT pathway, and therefore produce ISGs in response to IFN-b
stimulation.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/181404

<q> How long steps does dynein take?

<a> The stepping behavior of dyneins varies
depending on the source, as seen in the load dependence of step sizes in
mammalian (8) and Dicytostelium (11) dyneins. In contrast, ciliary dyneins
from Tetrahymena (19) and cytoplasmic dyneins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(9) take discrete 8 nm forward steps.

<na> Processive transport by multiple molecular motors that step stochastically,
requires a form of mechanical coupling. In a quantitative microtubule (MT)
gliding assay with yeast cytoplasmic dynein, we investigate the nature of this
coupling by examining the effect of MT length and motor density on transport.

<na> Such a rapid transition from random to
directed motility with increasing numbers of yeast dyneins, could play a role
in vivo during mitosis in the ‘search and orientation’ of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae nucleus.

<na> The study of dyneins at a single molecule level has gained momentum
more recently owing to their complexity (16), in contrast to kinesins, which
have been better studied (5, 17, 18).

<na> A better understanding of the quantitative nature of linear
MT transport by multiple dynein molecules, could improve our understanding
of the role of linear filaments bound by increasing numbers of motors in
nuclear positioning during mitosis.

<na> While individually both kinesins and dyneins step stochastically (9, 35,
36), the collective behaviour of both motor types involves a form of cooperativity.
This is evidenced by the increase and saturation in velocity with increasing
kinesin density (5). A model of ‘loose coupling’ of motors (37, 38) has
been observed in kinesin-1 (39), while other mechanisms such as fluctuation
based load-sharing (35, 40) and negative cooperativity of detachment (41, 42)
have also been proposed to enable collective transport.

<na> Here, we examine the in vitro transport of linear MTs by the minimal
S. cerevisiae dynein, that has served as a model dynein in single-molecule
studies (9, 20, 21, 43) and compare it to simulations.

<na> We have used a combination of experiment and theory to examine if increasing
numbers of a truncated minimal dynein motor are ‘coupled’ or interfere
with one another in collective transport.

<na> The model is described in greater detail in the Materials
and Methods section. We began by examining the effect of MT length and
motor density on collective dynein transport.

<na> We have modeled MT gliding on a sheet of uniformly distributed immobilized
dynein motors that are modeled as stochastic discrete steppers with attachment
and detachment dynamics, as described in detail in the Model section.

<q> Who runs longer: Two-motor kinesin-2 or Two-motor kinesin-1 assemblies?

<a> Two-motor kinesin-2 assemblies have longer run lengths than two-motor kinesin-1
assemblies.

<na> To understand these multi-motor
coordination mechanisms, defined pairs of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motors were assembled on DNA
scaffolds and their motility examined in vitro.

<na> Finally, cargo transported by kinesin-2 motors more effectively navigated roadblocks on
the microtubule track. These results highlight the importance of motor reattachment kinetics
during multi-motor transport and suggest a coordinated transport model in which kinesin-1 motors
step effectively against loads while kinesin-2 motors rapidly unbind and rebind to the microtubule.

<na> Because kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motors move with two-fold different speeds in the absence of
load(4), they do not appear to be an optimal pair for co-transport of intracellular cargos. They differ
in other ways as well – compared to kinesin-1, heterotrimeric kinesin-2 motors are less processive
and they detach much more readily under load(4-9).

<na> In contrast, kinesin-2 stepping is less affected
than kinesin-1 by roadblocks on microtubules such as MAPs(10). A comprehensive understanding
of bidirectional transport in neurons, and the transport defects that underlie neurodegenerative
disease requires understanding both how uniform populations motors coordinate their transport
activities and how diverse motors attached to a single cargo compete and coordinate to target cargo
to their proper intracellular locations.

<na> Although single kinesin-1 motors are robust transporters, previous experimental and
theoretical work has suggested that they do not coordinate their activities well(11, 12). This
property contrasts with dyneins – the finding that cargo stall forces are integer multiples of the
single-dynein stall force has been used to argue that dyneins efficiently couple their activities
during multi-motor transport(13, 14).

<na> Kinesin-based cargo transport in cells frequently involves the coordinated activity of multiple
motors, including kinesins from different families that move at different speeds. However, compared
to the progress at the single-molecule level, mechanisms by which multiple kinesins coordinate
their activity during cargo transport are poorly understood.

<na> Importantly,
transport in axons and dendrites is generally bidirectional; hence cargo have both plus-ended
kinesin motors and minus-ended dynein motors attached(2). Adding to this complexity, specific
cargo can have two classes of kinesins simultaneously bound; for instance, synaptotagmin-rich
axonal vesicles were shown to be transported simultaneously by kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motors(3).

<na> Based on the law of total expectation (19), we can calculate the reattachment rate for each
motor from the measured T1 and T2, as follows. Starting from the initial state with one motor
bound to the microtubule, there are two possibilities – either that motor will detach, terminating
the event, or the second motor will attach to the microtubule.

<na> These measurements are consistent with previous work that
found kinesin-1 detachment is less sensitive to force than kinesin-2(6, 7) and, together with the
reattachment data, paint a picture of kinesin-1 being a fast, stable, but stubborn partner and
kinesin-2 being a slow, vacillating, but adaptable partner in multi-motor transport.

<q> Does DNA sequence directly govern how DNA supercoils?

<a> Here, using a high-throughput single-molecule technique to visualize
DNA plectonemes (extended intertwined DNA loops that form upon twisting DNA), we discover
that DNA sequence directly governs the structure of supercoiled DNA.

<na> Control of DNA supercoiling is of vital importance to cells. Torsional strain induces supercoiling of DNA,
which triggers large structural rearrangements through the formation of extended plectonemes.

<na> We imaged individual plectonemes within 20 kb-long supercoiled DNA molecules. Consistent with
previous studies , we observed dynamic spots on the supercoiled DNA molecule (highlighted with
arrows in Fig1b-left and Supp.Movie1). Interestingly, the time-averaged fluorescence intensities of the
supercoiled DNA were not homogeneously distributed along the molecule (Fig.1b-top right), establishing
that plectoneme occurrence is position dependent. In contrast, torsionally relaxed (nicked) DNA displayed
a featureless homogenous time-averaged fluorescence intensity (Fig.1b-bottom right and Fig.S2).

<na> Plectonemes may also play a role in the bursting dynamics of gene expression, since each
RNAP alters the supercoiling density within a topological domain as it transcribes , adding or removing
nearby plectonemes. Finally, by bringing distant regions of DNA close together, plectonemes may influence
specific promoter-enhancer interactions to regulate gene expression.

<na> We then introduced a buffer consisting of 30nM of Sytox Orange (SxO), 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0, 20 mM NaCl, 0.4 mM EDTA, 2 mM trolox, 40 µg/ml glucose oxidase, 17 µg/ml catalase, and 5%
(wt/v) D-dextrose into the flow-cell to induce supercoiling on the surface-tethered molecules. Accumulation
of local unwinding due to binding of SxO molecules results in global positive supercoiling of the
topologically restrained DNA.

<na> We note that the numbers of plectoneme nucleation and termination events
along supercoiled DNA were equal (Fig.S2c-d), which is characteristic of a system at equilibrium.
Furthermore, we verified that increasing the NaCl concentration from 20 mM to 150 mM NaCl did not
result in any significant difference in the observed plectoneme density results, indicating that the
plectoneme density is not dependent of the ionic strength (Fig.S8).

<na> Supercoiled DNA intensity profiles, i.e.
single lines in the intensity kymograph, were converted to DNA-density profiles by comparing the intensity
profile of supercoiled DNA to that of the corresponding relaxed DNA.

<na> We determine how
strongly plectonemes are localized for a wide variety of DNA sequences, and we find that plectoneme
positioning can be predicted using the local curvature of the DNA which is set by the sequence.

<na> To study the average distribution of plectonemes along DNA, we prepared two DNA samples, one with a
homogeneous, and one with a strongly heterogeneous AT-content (Fig.1c, template1 and template2,
respectively).

<na> Next, we systematically examined the sequence-dependence of plectoneme localization by inserting short
DNA segments in the middle of the homogeneous template1 (Fig.2a and Fig.S3). First, we examined the
effect of AT-content, as the measured plectoneme densities in Fig.1c-d showed a weak correlation with the
local AT-percentage (R=0.33, Fig.S4).

<q> How β-CD might be obtained?

<a> Cyclodextrins (CDs) are a class of cyclic oligosaccharide compounds that can be obtained by
degradation of starch by α-1,4-glucan-glycosyltransferases. Depending on the number of glucopyranose
units (D-glucose), these compounds can be classified into 6 units (α-CD), 7 units (β-CD), 8 units (γ-CD)
and CDs of more glucopyranose units. In β-CD (Figure 1), the 7 glucopyranose units (D-glucose) enclose
a cavity with a diameter of about 6.5 Å.

<na> The water
entropy calculations show that entropy gain of desolvating water molecules are a major driving force, and
both force fields have the same strength of non-polar attractions between solutes and β-CD as well.

<na> In β-CD (Figure 1), the 7 glucopyranose units (D-glucose) enclose
a cavity with a diameter of about 6.5 Å. The glucopyranose units bring the center of the cavity a
hydrophobic surface of the carbon chains in the glucopyranose, whereas the rims of β-CD consist of
hydrophilic hydroxyl groups.

<na> β-CD consists of 147 atoms, so we can directly investigate the fundamentals of binding
thermodynamics and kinetics by MD simulations. Short MD simulations have been used to study ligand
binding affinity, dynamics, H-bonds and hydration properties of β-CD complexes.

<na> In most of these studies, the conformations of β-CD resemble the
crystal structures via shorter than 20 ns MD simulations, and no further dynamic information from
experiments or long-time-scale MD of β-CD complexes.

<na> Table SI 1 summarizes the
total lengths of all MD simulations and numbers of frames used in thermodynamics calculations. We also
performed 50-ns MD runs for free β-CD in a vacuum by using GAFF-CD and q4MD-CD to examine the
force field parameters, as detailed in SI Section 2.

<na> As mentioned previously, our MD
simulations can sample multiple association and dissociation events in one long run for each system. We
define the bound state for a complex when the center of mass of the ligand is within 7.5 Å from the center
of mass of β-CD.

<na> We used microsecond-timescale MD simulations with an explicit solvent model to compute the binding
enthalpies, entropies, and association/dissociation rate constants for β-CD with 7 guest molecules (Figure
1).

<na> Here we were able to separate enthalpy and entropy calculations, and we
therefore use directly computed ΔH and -TΔS to investigate their contributions of a guest and β-CD
binding.

<na> The intermolecular van der Waals (vdW) attraction between the β-CD and guest is one major
driving force for the complex formation (Tables 3 and 4). The water entropy gain on binding is also a
major driving force for the complex formation (Table 5). Interestingly, compared to q4MD-CD, the less
negative binding affinities using GAFF-CD are primarily from larger desolvation penalty, resulting in the
less negative binding enthalpy.

<q> Can light microscopy perform sub-millisecond sampling?

<a> We developed a light microscopy system capable of sub-millisecond sampling to
characterize molecular diffusion in heterogeneous aqueous environments
comparable to interstitial regions between cells in tissues.

<na> Scanning fluorescence methods such as stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) are
limited to ~1 Hz typical frame rates with faster imaging up to ~1,000 Hz possible by
trading image quality, while widefield approaches such as fast variants of
photoactivatable localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical
reconstruction microscopy (STORM) have integration times of ~tens of milliseconds
for individual image frames with full reconstructions commonly taking several
seconds.

<na> Our novel high-speed microscopy and analysis outperforms traditional
molecular mobility tools of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in being able to capture diffusional
heterogeneity relevant to real, complex biological systems exemplified by underlying
mobile and immobile states.

<na> Samples for fluorescence microscopy were prepared in tunnel slides formed by
placing two parallel lines of double-sided tape on a standard microscopy slide around
5 mm apart. A plasma cleaned coverslip was placed on top and carefully tapped down
(avoiding the imaging area) to create a water-tight tunnel.

<na> Bespoke fluorescence microscopy was performed on an inverted microscope body
(Nikon Eclipse Ti-S) with a 100x NA 1.49 Nikon oil immersion lens and illumination
from a supercontinuum laser (Fianium SC-400-6, Fianium Ltd.), controlled with an
acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF) to produce excitation light centred on
wavelength 619 nm (Supplementary Fig. 1).

*<na> Our method is the first, to our knowledge, to
enable sub-millisecond molecular tracking using a minimally perturbative nanoscale
organic dye reporter in a heterogeneous aqueous environment typical of interstitial
regions between cells in tissues.

<na> As expected, FRAP and FCS failed to report on the population of
bound immobilized chemokines, however, modelling the sub-millisecond tracking
data as a mixture of immobilized and mobile tracks generated excellent agreement
(Supplementary Table 3), corroborated through simulations of diffusing and
immobilized foci using realistic signal and background noise values (Supplementary
Note, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4).

<na> Whilst elastic and interferometric scattering can overcome
poor fluorophore photo-physics to enable rapid sampling they either utilise relatively
large probes that exhibit steric hindrance or achieve poor specificity in heterogeneous
sample environments unless used in conjunction with fluorescent labelling.

<na> The emergence of super-resolution imaging has had an enormous impact on biology,
enabling spatial localisation of single fluorescent probes more than an order of
magnitude better than the optical resolution limit of ~250 nm, facilitating direct
visualisation of dynamic molecular processes within complex biological systems.

<na> Chemokines are secreted within a dense,
heterogeneous microenvironment undergoing transient interactions with cognate
GPCRs and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) before undergoing
receptor-mediated scavenging or enzymatic degradation.

<q> What is sufficient for the formation of stable microtubule bundles?

<a> Here we show that random angular movement of
microtubules around the spindle pole and forces exerted by passive cross-linking proteins are
sufficient for the formation of stable microtubule bundles.

<na> Formation of antiparallel bundles of MTs in somatic cells
of higher eukaryotes was investigated by computer simulations, which include MTs that grow
in random directions from two spindle poles and motor proteins that link them (13). Further,
several studies have explored the forces generated in the antiparallel overlaps in vitro (14-16)
and in Drosophila embryo (17-19).

<na> MT rotational motion about a pivot at the SPB was also included in the model
for spindle formation (30) and in vitro studies (31). However, observation of the dynamics of
bundle formation in vivo and a corresponding physical model are required to understand the
formation and stability of MT bundles.

<na> In this paper, we combine experiments and theory to explore the formation of parallel
MT bundles.

<na> The process of MT bundle formation can be observed experimentally in the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe because of a small number of MTs in the spindle. At the onset
of mitosis, two spindle pole bodies nucleate MTs that form the spindle and additional MTs
grow from the spindle pole bodies performing angular motion (26).

<na> To systematically explore the formation of MT bundles and their stability, we first
examine the normalized potential describing the interaction between the MTs.

<a> In conclusion, our work implies that only passive processes, thermally driven motion
of the MTs and passive cross-linkers, are sufficient to describe the formation of parallel MT
bundles.

<na> Just like here, such model will give insight into the minimal requirements for the
formation of anti-parallel MT bundles and therefore shed additional light on the physics of
spindle formation.

<na> Time-lapse images and the
corresponding drawings showing the formation of a parallel MT bundle in an S. pombe cell
expressing tubulin-GFP and Sid4-GFP.

<na> During mitosis, bundles of microtubules form a spindle, but the physical mechanism of
bundle formation is still not known.

<q> What protein does mutate most frequently in human tumors?

<a> K-Ras is the most frequently mutated protein in human tumors. Activating K-Ras mutations
drive cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance, directly leading to nearly a million
deaths per year.

<na> Here, we present how the most recurrent K-Ras oncogenic mutation, G12D,
leads to structural, conformational and dynamical changes that lead to constitutively active KRas.
We have developed a new integrated MD simulation data analysis approach to quantify
such changes in a protein and applied it to K-Ras.

<a> K-Ras is the most frequently mutated oncoprotein in human cancers. Patients with
oncogenic K-Ras mutations have very poor response to standard therapies. Unfortunately,
K-Ras mutations eventually emerge during the course of their treatment and drive acquired
resistance.

<na> However, certain mutations in K-Ras impair its intrinsic GTPase function and
GAP binding and thereby GTP hydrolysis. Unable to switch to its GDP-bound inactive state,
mutant K-Ras remains continuously active, causing prolonged activation of downstream
pathways associated with oncogenic cell growth.

<na> In cancer patients, oncogenic K-Ras mutations are recurrently observed at positions 12, 13
and 61. G12 is the most frequently mutated residue (89%), which most prevalently mutates
to aspartate (G12D, 36%) followed by valine (G12V, 23%) and cysteine (G12C, 14%).

<na> Here, we present an in-depth study of how the most prevalent oncogenic K-Ras mutation,
G12D, triggers structural, conformational and dynamic changes in the protein that result in its
constitutive activation.

<na> From the CTC results, we first
studied the structural changes in both GTP and GDP-bound K-Ras upon G12D mutation,
and discovered salt bridges that are either formed or destroyed upon mutation. Second, we
evaluated the changes in the pair-wise distances between residues and quantified the local
volume changes to identify changes in protein conformation.

<na> To quantify the effect of the G12D mutation on the distances between K-Ras residue pairs,
we developed a new computational algorithm detailed in Figure S1. Briefly, we first assumed
K-RasWT as the initial state and K-RasG12D as the final state.

<na> In the mutated structure, D12 forms salt bridges with K16 (P-loop) and K88, and
K16 forms a salt bridge with D57. However, none of these interactions are present in KRASWT.
To identify the effects of the new electrostatic interactions caused by G12D mutation,
we then investigated the conformational changes in K-Ras.

<na> To uncover the
conformational differences between wild type and mutant K-Ras and to thereby better
understand the effects of the G12D mutation, we calculated the probability distributions of the
distances between pairs of residues that exhibited the largest changes in the distance
calculations.

<q> How large is ribosomal protein S1 in E. coli?

<a> E. coli ribosomal protein S1 is the largest protein of eubacterial ribosomes24-31, which
is a 557-residue modular protein composed of six independently-folded repeats of the S1
motif (Fig. 1A), a structural motif commonly found in proteins involved in RNA metabolism.

<na> Here we
characterized conformations, unfolding and dynamics of ribosomal protein S1 and its
D3/D5 domains using NMR, CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. S1 is a 557-residue
modular protein containing six S1 motifs. Paradoxically, while S1 is well-folded and
very soluble in vitro, it was found in various lists of aggregated E. coli proteins.

<na> Taken together, the results reveal the critical roles of protein
dynamics in aggregation of E. coli ribosomal protein S1, thus rationalizing the paradoxical
observation that while the S1 protein is both well-folded and highly soluble, it could be prone
to aggregation in cells with high salt concentrations.

<na> Although all six S1 repeats of E. coli ribosomal protein S1 assume the conserved S1
motif with the β-barrel fold, the D3 and D5 domains appear to have higher min-hr dynamics
than other four S1 repeats, whose NMR structures have been previously determined with the
input of many hydrogen-bond constraints derived from the slow-exchange-rate backbone
amide protons.

<na> We are particularly interested in understanding the
observed paradox that while E. coli ribosomal protein S1 was characterized to be well-folded
and highly soluble, it has been also found in all lists of aggregated proteins of E. coli cells,
even in the healthy cells without significant oxidative stress.

<na> Therefore, the salt-enhanced aggregation of E. coli ribosomal protein S1 is
expected to follow the same mechanism previously established for “completely insoluble”
and aggregation-prone protein.

<na> Unlike mammalian aging associated with many hallmarks, E. coli aging is only
significantly characterized by protein aggregation, thus offering an excellent model for
addressing the relationship between protein aggregation and aging.

<na> Most intriguingly, asymmetric segregation of protein
aggregates has been recently revealed to be characteristic of the cellular aging and
rejuvenation of E. coli cells.

<na> As shown in Fig. 1C, the full-length S1 protein has a far-UV CD spectrum very
similar to that of the S1 protein directly purified from E. coli cells without over-expression.

<na> It had been widely thought that reproduction by asymmetric division is a prerequisite
for aging until the recent discovery that even E. coli cells progressively decline in growth
rate and reproductive ability, thus revealing that no life can escape the attack of aging.
One universal characteristic associated with aging of organisms from human being down to E.
coli cells is aggregation of hundreds and thousands of non-specific proteins.

<q> Has DNA sequence any effect nucleosome repositioning?

<a> Specifically, a sequence with a strong nucleosome positioning signal slides via large jumps
by five and ten base pairs, preserving the optimal DNA bending profile. On the other hand, uniform
sequences without the positioning signal slide via a screw-like motion of DNA, one base pair at the time.
These results show that sequence has a large effect not only on the formation of nucleosomes, but also on the
kinetics of repositioning.

<na> While nucleosome positioning on eukaryotic genome play important roles for genetic regulation,
molecular mechanisms of nucleosome positioning and sliding along DNA are not well understood.

<na> Nucleosomes are fundamental units of chromatin folding consisting of double-stranded DNA
wrapped ~1.7 times around a histone octamer. By densely populating the eukaryotic genome, nucleosomes
enable efficient genome compaction inside the cellular nucleus. However, the portion of DNA occupied by a
nucleosome can hardly be accessed by other DNA-binding proteins, obstructing fundamental cellular
processes such as DNA replication and transcription.

<a> We find that the sliding mode is highly dependent on the underlying
DNA sequence. Specifically, a sequence with a strong nucleosome positioning signal slides via large jumps
by five and ten base pairs, preserving the optimal DNA bending profile.

<na> Nucleosomes are the fundamental structural unit of eukaryotic chromatin, composed of
approximately 147 base pairs (bp) of double stranded DNA wrapped around a histone octamer [1].
Nucleosomes enable genomic DNA to be folded into chromatin and efficiently packed inside the cell nucleus.

<na> How are nucleosome positions regulated in the cell? Nucleosome assembly is strongly dependent on
the underlying DNA sequence [7], and it has been shown that sequence indeed significantly contributes to
the observed pattern of nucleosome positions in vivo?

<na> Nucleosomes may also undergo spontaneous repositioning in the absence of active remodelers [11].
While the importance of this mechanism in vivo has not been carefully investigated, many in vitro studies,
e.g. using 2-dimensional electrophoresis [12] and atomic force microscopy [13], confirmed the existence of
spontaneous nucleosome sliding.

<na> Here we investigated thermally-activated spontaneous nucleosome sliding dynamics by employing a
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. While all-atom MD simulations have been widely used to
study the molecular details of nucleosome conformation and histone-DNA interactions [19–22], it would be
computationally challenging to reach the time-scales relevant to observe spontaneous sliding.

<na> In this work, we aim to reveal the dynamics of spontaneous nucleosome repositioning using the
AICG2+ and 3SPN.2C coarse-grained models, and study the influence of DNA sequence on this process. To
achieve this, an appropriate representation of histone-DNA interactions is of particular importance.

<na> Then, we performed MD simulations of nucleosomes using different DNA
sequences, and identified two distinct sliding modes: one, coupled to DNA rotation, for uniform and nonpositioning
sequences, and a second, uncoupled to rotation, for a strong nucleosome positioning sequence.

<q> How fast fast-folding proteins fold in silico?

<na> As demonstrated below, use of the methods and forcefield outlined above resulted in
accurate prediction of τs for CLN025 and Trp-cage (TC10b) and an answer to the important
question of how fast fast-folding proteins fold in silico. A total of 160 distinct, independent,
unrestricted, unbiased, isobaric–isothermal, microsecond MD simulations with a total
aggregated simulation time of 1,011.2 µs were used for the prediction.

<a> The present study shows that agreements within factors of 0.69–1.75 between the
experimental and simulated τs have been achieved for CLN025 and Trp-cage (Table 1). These
agreements indicate that fast-folding proteins CLN025 and Trp-cage can now autonomously
fold in simulations as fast as in experiments, and provide an answer to the important question of
how fast fast-folding proteins fold in silico.

<na> These agreements also suggest that the accuracy of
folding simulations for fast-folding proteins is beginning to overlap with the accuracy of folding
experiments. This opens new prospects of combining simulation with experiment to develop
computer algorithms that can predict ensembles of conformations and their interconversion
rates for a protein from its sequence.

<na> In reported microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations, fast-folding proteins CLN025 and
Trp-cage autonomously folded to experimentally determined native conformations. However,
the folding times of these proteins derived from the simulations were more than 4–10 times
longer than their experimental values.

<a> This article reports autonomous folding of CLN025 and
Trp-cage in isobaric–isothermal molecular dynamics simulations with agreements within factors
of 0.69–1.75 between simulated and experimental folding times at different temperatures. These
results show that CLN025 and Trp-cage can now autonomously fold in silico as fast as in
experiments, and suggest that the accuracy of folding simulations for fast-folding proteins begins
to overlap with the accuracy of folding experiments.

<na> How fast can fast-folding proteins autonomously fold in silico? This question is important
because experimental folding times (τs) [1-3] are rigorous benchmarks for evaluating the
accuracy of protein folding simulations.

<a> Most
reported τs to date suggest that fast-folding proteins cannot autonomously fold in silico as fast as
in experiments. This implies an accuracy gap between simulation and experiment for protein
folding rate (1/τ) that is determined by folding mechanism or pathways.

<na> A fast-folding protein in a fully extended backbone conformation was solvated with the
TIP3P water [22] with surrounding counter ions and/or NaCls and then energy-minimized for
100 cycles of steepest-descent minimization followed by 900 cycles of conjugate-gradient
minimization to remove close van der Waals contacts using SANDER of AMBER 11 (University
of California, San Francisco).

<na> The τ of a fast-folding protein was estimated from the mean time-to-folding in 40 distinct,
independent, unrestricted, unbiased, and isobaric–isothermal MD simulations using survival
analysis methods [21] implemented in the R survival package Version 2.38-3 (http://cran.rproject.org/package=survival).

<na> n the present study, a stringent CαβRMSD of ≤0.98 Å for the full sequence of CLN025 or
Trp-cage was used to define the native structural ensemble, in contrast to the use of CαRMSD
for a fast-folding protein with truncations on terminal residues.

<q> What determines the size of spindles?

<a> Thus, the size of spindles is determined by the distance where one
microtubule nucleates on average less than one new microtubule. This mechanism
provides an upper limit to spindle size even when resources are not limiting and may
have implications for spindle scaling during development.

<na> Regulation of size and growth is a fundamental problem in biology. A prominent
example is the formation of the mitotic spindle, where protein concentration gradients
around chromosomes are thought to regulate spindle growth by controlling
microtubule nucleation.

<a> Combining this method with theory and quantitative
microscopy, we show that the size of a spindle is controlled by autocatalytic growth
of microtubules, driven by microtubule-stimulated microtubule nucleation.

<na> However, the role of the Ran
gradient in determining spindle size is still controversial. For instance, in cell culture
systems, the length scale of the Ran gradient does not correlate with spindle size.

<na> Understanding the role of microtubule nucleation in
setting the size of spindles is limited by the fact that little is known about the rate,
distribution, and regulation of microtubule nucleation in spindles.

<na> This inhibition stops microtubule transport and leads to the formation of
radially symmetric monopolar spindles (monopoles) that have a similar size as regular
spindles (20, 21) (Fig. 1A and S1). The location of minus ends in these monopoles
exactly corresponds to the location of microtubule nucleation.

<na> These
results suggest that monopolar spindles grow to a size larger than an individual
microtubule by microtubule-stimulated microtubule nucleation in physical proximity
to pre-existing microtubules, which creates an autocatalytic wave of microtubule
growth.

<na> These observations raise the question of how spindles reach a finite size
through autocatalytic growth (as in the control and MCAK-inhibited monopoles). One
possibility is that microtubule dynamics change as a result of limiting amounts of
tubulin or microtubule-associated proteins.

<na> To test whether a limited pool of active nucleators can quantitatively account for the
size and microtubule nucleation in these microtubule structures, we developed a
biophysical model of autocatalytic microtubule nucleation (see Fig. 4A and materials
and methods).

<na> Since the length scale of the gradient is amplified by microtubulestimulated
nucleation, the relevant length scale for setting the size is the distance at
which a microtubule generates one or fewer microtubules.

<q> What to do with the hole in TM center of AcrB in simulation?

<a> A large hole with a diameter of ~30 Å in the TM center of AcrB
should be filled with phospholipids to avoid proton leakage across the membrane. Twelve POPE
molecules were manually packed into the hole (six for the upper leaflet and six for the lower
leaflet).

<na> The multidrug transporter AcrB transports a broad range of drugs out of the cell by means of the
proton-motive force. The asymmetric crystal structure of trimeric AcrB suggests a functionally
rotating mechanism for drug transport.

<na> . AcrB is an inner
membrane protein, primarily responsible for specificity towards drugs and their uptake, as well
as for energy transduction. AcrA acts as an adaptor which bridges TolC and AcrB.

<na> In contrast
to small transporters, where substrate efflux and energy transduction are spatially coupled in the
TM domain, drug efflux by AcrB occurs in the periplasmic space, spatially separate (~50 Å
apart) from the proton translocation sites in the TM domain.

<na> Eicher et al.
showed by X-ray crystallography of AcrB mutants combined with MD simulations that these
conformational changes in the TM domain were related to the alternate access of water, and in
turn to the functional rotation.

<na> Using an explicit solvent/lipid all-atom model (480,074
atoms), we identified conformational transition pathways in one step of the functional rotation
for the complete AcrB trimers with different protonation states.

<na> We further quantified the contribution from the drug-protein interactions at each image
by calculating the absolute drug binding free energy to AcrB (see Methods). The absolute
binding free energy in system 2 is plotted in Fig 2b with the black line. The binding free energy
increases rapidly at around images 10-20, prompting detailed structural analyses for the
implication (Figs. 2c and 2d).

<na> The crystal structure of the asymmetric AcrB trimer (PDB entry: 4DX531 300 ) with bound
minocycline in the distal binding pocket of protomer I (B state) was used for MD simulations.
The AcrB trimer was embedded in an equilibrated lipid bilayer membrane of POPE (1-
palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine).

<na> The water box size comparable to the AcrB system was used to
cancel out the system size effect . From two free energy differences, an absolute binding energy
was calculated for each image over a thermodynamic cycle. The error propagation rule was
applied to obtain final statistical uncertainties.

<na> Eicher, T. et al. Transport of drugs by the multidrug transporter AcrB involves an access
and a deep binding pocket that are separated by a switch-loop.

<q> Is DRP1 sufficient for mitochondrial fission?

<a> DRP1 is necessary but not sufficient for mitochondrial fission because receptor
proteins must recruit the enzyme to the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane (OMM). In
mammals, these include the paralogs MItochondrial Dynamics proteins MID49 and
MID51 or the Mitochondrial Fission Factor, MFF.

<na> Recent work also led to the discovery of the role
mitochondrial fission plays in regulated cell death pathway, brain development and
synaptic function, and how certain pathogens disrupt these processes and hijack
mitochondrial resources.

<na> We note that even the most constricted form of the closed ring is insufficient to
drive complete mitochondrial fission because the inner diameter is only ~16nm. This
length suggests that a constricted membrane tubule would be stable and that the
structures we have observed in vitro could correspond with the highly-constricted but pre-
fission state observed in living cells when another dynamin-family protein, the primarily
endocytic dynamin-2, is depleted.

<na> The selective stabilization of this open, elongated
conformation of DRP1 within the MID receptor cofilament explains why overexpression
of the MID receptors inhibits mitochondrial fission.

<na> Here we present a cryoEM structure
of human, full-length DRP1 bound to MID49 and an analysis of structure- and disease-
based mutations.

<na> Subsequent GTP hydrolysis and exchange within the filament
leads to receptor dissociation, shortening through disassembly, and concomitant curling
of DRP1 oligomers into closed rings. The dimensions of the closed DRP1 rings are
consistent with DRP1-constricted mitochondrial tubules observed in human cells.

<na> Following receptor-dependent
recruitment, DRP1 assembles into polymers that encircle mitochondria and, through still
poorly understood mechanisms, channels energy from GTP binding, hydrolysis, and
nucleotide exchange into a mechanochemical constriction.

<na> Thus, mitochondrial division is a stepwise reaction
regulated by DRP1 receptor binding, oligomerization and nucleotide-dependent
conformational dynamics.

<na> Surprisingly, each chain of DRP1 bound
MID49 at four different sites, and each MID49 in turn bound four DRP1 molecules to yield
a vast and highly avid interaction network (Figs. 1b-c, Extended Data Figs. 4 and 8).
MID49 binding to four separate DRP1 molecules stabilized a linear arrangement of inter-
DRP1 interfaces reminiscent of those observed for other dynamin-family proteins by Xray
crystallography (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Figs. 4 and 8).

<na> We observed that the GMPPCP-bound G-domains and the BSE of
DRP1 adopt strikingly different conformations in the cryoEM density compared to the
nucleotide-free crystal structure.

<q> How represent soil at microbial scale?

<a> As soil can be approximated at the microbial scale as a physical
network of growth chambers linked by channels (P´erez-Reche et al. 2012), this model provides the
basis for the description of complex natural networks or artificial regular networks (see Figure 1)
and the microbial interactions therein.

<na> However, the homogenous environment of
nutrient agarose does not possess the intrinsic geometric or topological structure of real microbial
environments, such as the matrix of soil or a biofilm. Mutualistic microbial dynamics have not thus
far been studied in such structured environments.

<na> The results presented below were obtained from numerical studies of the mathematical model with
parameter values corresponding to the mutualistic association between Lobomonas rostrata, a B12-
requiring green alga, and Mesorhizobium loti, a B12-producing soil bacterium.

<na> We also performed a test to check
for cross-migration of the mutualistic species. Both flasks were filled with a rich bacterial medium
for soil bacteria (TY), but only one side was inoculated with M. loti (see below for strain details).

<na> Complex microbial communities play essential roles in the proper functioning of the environment,
in maintaining the health of plants and animals, and in many industrial processes.
Within these communities, microbial interactions are often predicated on metabolite exchange,
as auxotrophs depend on nutrients made by other microbes.

<na> Solutions to
the model reveal rich dynamics, and allow prediction of the conditions for the successful establishment
of remote mutualisms. We connect our findings to understanding complex behaviour in
synthetic and naturally occurring microbial communities.

<na> Here, we study a model of mutualistic microbial species in a simple geometry representing a
minimal unit for a structured environment: populations growing in spatially separated reservoirs,
metabolically linked by a channel.

<na> The model describes two populations of mutualistic microbial species, A and B, interacting at a
distance. The mutualistic interactions are predicated on auxotrophy: A requires metabolite V
(for “vitamin”), excreted by B; conversely B requires metabolite C (for “carbon”), excreted by
A. In formulating the problem we shall first use variables with an overbar to denote dimensional
quantities (concentrations, time, space), reserving symbols without typographical modification for
appropriately rescaled variables.

<na> The long time
steady-state for the model is always extinction of B once it has exhausted the remote resource.
However, separation of the microbial population from the source modifies the transient population
dynamics.

<na> We see that increasing the channel length has the effect of pushing the crash-coexistence boundary
toward higher initial microbial concentrations. Coexistence is achieved in the membrane limit for
initial concentrations lower than those for finite λ. The boundary between crash and coexistence
regions shifts quantitatively with λ, but does not change significantly qualitatively.

<q> What is the gliding velocity of Mycoplasma mobile?

<a> Mycoplasma mobile is a bacterium that uses a unique mechanism to glide on solid
surfaces at a velocity of up to 4.5 µm/s. Its gliding machinery comprises hundreds of
units that generate the force for gliding based on the energy derived from ATP; the units
catch and pull on sialylated oligosaccharides fixed to solid surfaces.

<na> Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that parasitizes animals. Dozens of Mycoplasma
species glide over the tissues of their hosts during infection. The gliding machinery of
Mycoplasma mobile, the fastest species, includes intracellular motors and hundreds of
legs on the cell surface.

<na> Dozens of parasitic
Mycoplasma species, such as the fish pathogen Mycoplasma mobile (3-5) and the
human pathogen Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6-8), have protrusions, and exhibit gliding
motility in the direction of the protrusions on solid surfaces, which enables
mycoplasmas to parasitize other organisms.

<na> Members of the bacterial class Mollicutes, which includes the genus Mycoplasma, are
parasitic and occasionally commensal bacteria that are characterized by small cells and
genomes, and by the absence of a peptidoglycan layer (1, 2).

<na> Interestingly, Mycoplasma gliding does
not involve flagella or pili, and is completely unrelated to other bacterial motility
systems, or the conventional motor proteins that are common in eukaryotic motility.
M. mobile, which can be isolated from the gills of freshwater fish, is a fast-gliding
Mycoplasma (9-13).

<a> M. mobile, which can be isolated from the gills of freshwater fish, is a fast-gliding
59 Mycoplasma (9-13). It glides smoothly and continuously on glass at an average speed
60 of 2.0–4.5 µm/s, or 3–7 times the length of the cell per second.

<na> The substituted amino acid in FtsH is not conserved in other
mycoplasmas except for Mycoplasma pulmonis, a closely related species. MvspI is
probably not involved in gliding, as described above (23). SecY is generally essential
for protein secretion in bacteria (44).

<na> The substitution in SecY probably affects the
secretion of gliding proteins, resulting in a reduction in the binding activity of cells,
because the amino acid substituted in the mutant is conserved in many mycoplasmas,
including Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma bovis, and M. pulmonis.

<na> Its gliding machinery comprises hundreds of
units that generate the force for gliding based on the energy derived from ATP; the units
catch and pull on sialylated oligosaccharides fixed to solid surfaces.

<na> Considering the 70-nm step size, this small
unit force may be explained by the large gear ratio involved in the M. mobile gliding
machinery.

<q> What are the critical signaling motifs of µOR?

<a> By analyzing both the kinetic slowness of inter-residue contacts with tICA as well as their
PageRank in the transfer entropy network of µOR (cf. methods for more details), we determined
the critical signaling motifs of the receptor. Both metrics identify a quartet of residues –
D1473.32, F2896.44, W2936.48, and Y3267.43, which we term DFWY – as a critical gate of
activation (Figure 1, E.D. Table 5, E.D. Figure 9).

<na> Subsequently, the
distinct docked poses, which demonstrated significant differences in orientation, were then
simulated in NAMD on the BlueWaters supercomputer. The pose with the lowest average
RMSD in simulation was then selected for use in further MD simulation.

<na> Complementarily,
mutations in E341H8 have been shown to significantly modulate the constitutive activity of
µOR. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that this ω4 high state (Fig. 2c, Fig. 3)
precedes the inactive crystal structure on the overall activation pathway.

<na> The µ Opioid Receptor (µOR) is a G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) that
mediates pain and is a key target for clinically administered analgesics. The current generation of
prescribed opiates – drugs that bind to µOR – engender dangerous side effects such as
respiratory depression and addiction in part by stabilizing off-target conformations of the
receptor.

<na> To determine both the key conformations of µOR to atomic resolution as well as the
transitions between them, long timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted
and analyzed.

<na> In this paper, we endeavor to (1) discover states of µOR that have thus far been refractory to
crystallography and (2) juxtapose how opiates of different scaffold classes tune the receptor
toward distinct conformational energy landscapes. To achieve these aims, we conducted
unbiased, atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of µOR for 250 µs in each of three
conditions: unliganded, BU72-bound, and Sufentanil-bound.

<na> Entropy approaches define two related measures of importance for each
amino acid residue in µOR. By measuring slowness, tICA identifies groups of amino acid
residues whose transitions constitute the highest kinetic barriers to conformational change in the
system of interest.

<na> Specific to µOR, stark thermodynamic differences are observed between the behavior
of BU72 and of Sufentanil. The statistical models reveal allosteric modulation pathways that
connect perturbations in the ligand binding pocket with global conformational changes of the
receptor.

<na> By analyzing both the kinetic slowness of inter-residue contacts with tICA as well as their
PageRank in the transfer entropy network of µOR (cf. methods for more details), we determined
the critical signaling motifs of the receptor.

<na> In addition, receptor deactivation, in which µOR transitions from its active
crystal-like structure toward either an inactive crystal-like or other terminally inactive state, is
triggered by reconfigurations of these residues.

<q> What resolution high-resolution optical tweezers may achieve?

<na> In our approach single proteins attached to membranes
supported on silica beads are pulled by optical tweezers, allowing membrane binding and
unbinding transitions to be measured with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution.

<na> However, high resolution single-molecule methods to probe protein-membrane interactions in the
presence of force are lacking.

<a> High-resolution OTs achieve extremely high spatiotemporal resolution (~0.3 nm,
~20 µs) in a range of force that can reversibly unfold a biomolecule or is generated by molecular
motors.

<na> We have developed a single-molecule assay based on high-resolution OTs to measure the
energy and kinetics of membrane binding by C2 domains of Syt1 and E-Syt2. Our method can be
generally applied to study complex protein-membrane interactions with unprecedented
spatiotemporal resolution.

<na> High-resolution dual-trap OTs pull a single molecule tethered between two beads, forming a
dumbbell in solution suspended by optical traps (Figure 1A).

<na> Interestingly,
although Syt1 C2A and C2B domains do not associate as in E-Syt2 (Zhou et al., 2015), the two
Syt1 C2 domains bound to and unbound from membranes simultaneously within our instrumental
resolution, as is indicated by the two-state transition (Figure 2E).

<na> Reversible protein-membrane
binding is detected based on the associated extension changes with high spatiotemporal resolution,
thus allowing us to derive binding affinity and kinetics as a function of force, soluble factors, and
lipid compositions.

<na> One of the beams is reflected by a mirror
attached to a piezoelectrical actuator that turns the mirror along two axes with high resolution
(Nano-MTA2, Mad City Labs, WI). The two beams are then combined by another polarizing beam
splitter, further expanded two fold by a telescope, and focused by a water immersion 60X objective
with a numerical aperture of 1.2 (Olympus, PA) to form two optical traps.

<na> Here we used optical tweezers (OTs) to measure both the energy and the detailed kinetics of
interactions between single proteins and lipid bilayers. OTs use tightly focused laser beams to trap
silica or polystyrene beads in a harmonic potential (Zhang et al., 2013) (Figure 1A).

<na> The optical tweezers were home-built and assembled on an optical table in an acoustically-isolated
and temperature-controlled room as previously described (Moffitt et al., 2006; Sirinakis et al.,
2012).

<q> Is Dimethyl-β-CD a better catalyst for Diels-Alder reaction between 9-anthracenemethanol and N-cyclohexylmaleimide
than β-CD?

<a> Dimethyl-β-CD is found to be a better catalyst for this specific reaction
than β-CD because it outperforms β-CD in almost every step of catalysis. It binds Ncyclohexylmaleimide
more tightly, holds both 9-anthracenemethanol and Ncyclohexylmaleimide
for much longer time in its binding site, and pays smaller entropy penalty
to the activation free energy of the transition state.

<na> Reactants bind to cyclodextrins before the catalyzed reactions would happen. Since the cavity of
the studied cyclodextrins is only large enough to accommodate one reactant, we calculated the
binding free energies of 1 or 2a to β-CD or dimethyl-β-CD by the VM2 method [16] in order to
find out which reactant binds first.

<na> Despite its limitations, PM3 method
characterizes correctly the bond breaking and formation of Diels-Alder reaction and is a practical
method for large systems as in this work. Reaction paths and transition states (TSs) with and
without β-CD and dimethyl-β-CD catalysts were calculated using Gaussian 09W package [32,
33].

<na> Table 1 lists the binding free energies and breakdowns between reactants and cyclodextrins.
Compound 2a has a binding affinity of -6.578 kcal/mol with β-CD, stronger than that with
dimethyl-β-CD by 0.4 kcal/mol. However, this advantage mainly comes from the lower entropy
penalty with β-CD.

<na> The
poor solubility of β-CD is believed to be attributed to this stable hydrogen bonding network and
methylation is employed to break this network to increase the solubility [34]. However, the
hydroxyl groups on dimethyl-β-CD are not able to interact with the carbonyl group on 2a either.

<na> The MMPB/SA
energies are consistent with the VM2 results in that dimethyl-β-CD has stronger enthalpy
contribution to the binding with 2a than β-CD, that the dominant contributor is van der Waals
interaction, and that the overall electrostatic interaction is positive.

<na> The Bond Length Scanning
result can be found in Figure 5. For simplicity only the result from the starting conformation
without hydrogen bonds for β-CD and dimethyl-β-CD is presented.

<na> The energy barriers are roughly 40.9, 30.7 and 25.7 kcal/mol for TS alone, TS with β-CD, and
TS with dimethyl-β-CD, respectively. These values indicate that both β-CD and dimethyl-β-CD
can lower the energy barriers and accelerate the reactions, and their rankings are in agreement
with what was observed in the experiment by Chaudhuri, S. et. al.

<a> The
activation free energy for TS alone is as high as 49.04 kcal/mol, which is in the range of
experimental activation free energies for typical Diels-Alder reactions [35, 36]. Cyclodextrins
lower the energy barriers significantly and dimethyl-β-CD performs better than β-CD, in
agreement with the experimental observation [15].

<na> The calculated activation free energies can be decomposed into enthalpy and entropy terms. The
first sets of both β-CD and dimethyl-β-CD complexes have lower enthalpy term than the second
set, suggesting that the hydrogen bonds, if exist, may help to stabilize the transition state.

<q> What misfunction of CDK8 may cause?

<a> Abnormal activities of CDK8 and its partner CycC are related to a variety of
human cancers.

<na> CDK8 forms
a complex with cyclin C (CycC), Med12, Med13 and performs phosphorylation involved
with positive and negative signaling of transcription and regulation of transcription
activities.

<na> CDK8 has an allosteric binding site adjacent to the ATP binding
controlled by a DMG motif (Asp-Met-Gly) that characterizes the DFG-in/DFG-out
conformations as in other protein kinases.

<na> The
computed PMF plots indicate clear energy barriers that correspond to and originate from
the hydrogen bond (H-bond) formations and important interactions between ligand and
CDK8, and also protein motions featured by relative motions of N-lobe, C-lobe of CDK8
and CycC.

<na> We noticed that ligand 2 forms half less H-bonds with
CDK8 and requires minor protein motions for it to dissociate compared to ligand 1.
Therefore, the faster kinetics may be an intrinsic property underlying in the ligand 2
dissociation pathway found by metadynamics. The same reversed rank of ligand 1 and 2
was reported previously.

<na> β1-2 on the N-lobe of
CDK8 moves up for one or two Å to open the ATP binding site, and the R-group of the
ligand 1 is unlocked (L1-A).

<na> The bulky part of the ligand
passes through the narrow tunnel between αC helix and activation loop and results in the
energy barrier E. Finally, the ligand gets solvated on the surface of CDK8 (L1-F and L1-
G).

<na> The distance between centers of mass of the heavy atoms on the ligands and
the heavy atoms of residue 26 to 38 96 to 106 356 to 359 on CDK8 were chosen as the
collective variables (CVs), and the forces from the Gaussian functions were only applied
on the atoms in the ligands.

<na> This is because the stretching motion and preparation
for dissociation of ligand 1 can be clearly distinguished by PC1/PC2 space path, but for
ligand 2 the motions in the first 20 ns metadynamics simulations are dominated by protein
and ligand vibrations near the same bound state so that the track of these regions in
PC1/PC2 space are convoluted and we cannot separate the motions using our approach
(Figure SI 4).

<na> The first distinguishable energy barriers for these ligands are
also from the motion when the ligand passes through αC helix. The other major energy
barriers in the PMFs of these ligands are from desolvation of the ligands.

<q> Does catalytic HNH domain of significantly move during the fluctuations?

<a> Here, we applied single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to
directly characterize conformational dynamics of individual Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. We
showed that Cas9 spontaneously fluctuates among three conformational states accompanied by
remarkable movements of the catalytic HNH domain.

<a> Here, using intra-molecular single molecule fluorescence
resonance energy transfer measurements, we revealed that Cas9 in apo, sgRNA-bound, and
dsDNA/sgRNA-bound forms all spontaneously transits between three major conformational
states, mainly reflecting significant conformational mobility of the catalytic HNH domain.

<na> Using ensemble FRET measurements, Sternberg
and coworkers have shown that the catalytic HNH domain of Cas9 is highly dynamic and its
conformational state correlates with DNA cleavage activity (Sternberg et al., 2015).

<na> Our results suggested that Cas9
utilizes a proofreading mechanism through a long-range allosteric communication between the
PAM-distal end and its catalytic HNH domain. Interactions between several Cas9 residues and
RNA/DNA heteroduplex at the distal end trigger Cas9 to transiently sample its "cleavagecompetent"
closed state to mediate DNA cleavage, whereas 4 or more mismatches between
sgRNA and DNA cause incorrect positioning of the HNH domain and a transiently-formed
"cleavage-impaired" closed state.

<na> The conformation of catalytic HNH domain is relative conserved and
Cas9 exhibits an “open” conformation in apo and sgRNA-bound forms (Jiang et al., 2015; Jinek
et al., 2014).

<na> Objective-based total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope was used to capture
smFRET trajectories of individual Cas9 molecules under equilibrium conditions (steady state),
which enabled us to track conformational dynamics of Cas9 catalytic HNH domain by
monitoring the relative distance changes between Cy3 and Cy5 labeling sites.

<na> Off-target binding and cleavage by Cas9 pose as major challenges in its applications.
How conformational dynamics of Cas9 governs its nuclease activity under on- and off- target
conditions remains largely unknown.

<na> Several Cas9 residues were likely to mediate the allosteric
communication and proofreading step. Modulating interactions between Cas9 and heteroduplex
at the distal end by introducing mutations on these sites provides an alternative route to improve
and optimize the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox.

<na> Cas9 has been shown to recognize and cleave DNA target bearing imperfect
complementarity towards RNA guide sequence, particularly when mismatches are present at the
PAM-distal end (Fu et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2013; Lim et al., 2016; Sternberg et al., 2015).

<na> However,
the conformational dynamics and molecular mechanisms of Cas9 governing its nuclease activity
under on- and off- target conditions remain largely unresolved.

<q> How Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 is grown?

<a> For experimental purposes Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 were grown
photoheterotrophicaly in yeast extract supplemented RCV medium (4g Malic acid, 1g
NH4Cl, 120 mg MgCl2, 75 mg CaCl2, 20 mg Sodium EDTA salt, 1mg Nicotinic acid, 10
mM KPO4 buffer, 1000 ml dH2O supplemented with 0.3g Yeast extract powder, PH 6.8
+0.2). The culture was incubated at room temperature under continuous illumination
for 6-8 days[29] in screw cap bottles.

<na> We show in support of this hypothesis that prolonged photoexitation
of cell free extract of Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 at 395 nm, induces
fluorescence emission amplifying with time as long as the fluorophore density is above
a critical level.

<na> Single cells of Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 shows time
dependent loss of fluorescence, the process being reversed for cellular clusters. To
explain the mechanism of this bistable fluorescence (F) amplification, variation of
the scale free kinetic constant k=1/F (dF/dt) is studied at varying temperatures in
presence and absence of static magnetic field.

<na> We show bistability in fluorescence emission from Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003, the
switchability interestingly depends on fluorophore concentration and temperature. The
bistability that we report here is not in terms of onset of fluorescence but in terms of
amplification or quenching of the same.

<na> Photosynthetic purple non-sulfur bacteria Rhodobacter capsulatus SB1003 is one of the
most primitive photoheterotroph that contain photoreceptors in the form of porphyrin
derivatives like non-covalently bound cofactors, bacterio-chlorophyll and bacteriopheophytin
in the reaction centres of their photosynthetic membrane complexes.

<na> The full grown bacterial culture and the cell free
extract were used for monitoring fluorescence properties.

<a> When Rhodobacter capsulatus cells are grown under anaerobic or micro-aerophilic
condition in presence of continuous light they do accumulate tetrapyrroles (Protoporphyrin,
Mg-protoporphyrin derivatives) [34]. Porphyrins containing tetrapyrroles easily
interact non-covalently because of the presence of pi bonds, commonly known as pi
stacking and lead to self assembly [36, 37].

<na> Notably in spite of the presence of such a vast literature bistability has not been
reported for a natural photosynthetic or cyno-bacteria. In general we find different
classes of fluorescent biomolecules that are [9, 10] mostly susceptible to photo-bleaching.
The work was inspired by our preliminary observation that we made while studying the
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment.

<na> The term bistability, is a concept implying a duality of steady states, pouring in biological
literature in different contexts [1]. Broadly it expresses a switching from one
steady state to another if a parameter is varied. Thus in genetics, epigenetics [2]and
microbial ecology [3] bistability appears in order to describe existence of a dual genomic
or ecological equilibria. It also appeared in sudden switching of oxygen concentration
during the evolution of the bio-geosphere [4].

<na> Numerous models have been reported where the role of microbes
in overall metabolic energy transfer circuitry of different ecological niche have been
emphasized.

<q> Can change in blood pH trigger myotoniain P1158S patients?

<a> Using action potential modeling we also predict a pH-to-phenotype
correlation in patients with P1158S. We conclude that activities which alter blood pH may trigger
myotonia or periodic paralysis in P1158S patients.

<na> keletal muscle channelopathies, many of which are inherited as autosomal dominant
mutations, include both myotonia and periodic paralysis. Myotonia is defined by a delayed
relaxation after muscular contraction, whereas periodic paralysis is defined by episodic attacks of
weakness.

<na> Interestingly, the P1158S missense mutant, located in the
third domain S4-S5 linker of the ‘‘skeletal muscle’’ voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4, has
been implicated in causing both myotonia and hypoPP.

<na> Nav1.4 mutants can mostly cause either hyper- or hypo-excitability in skeletal
muscles, leading to conditions such as myotonia or periodic paralysis. P1158S uniquely causes
both phenotypes. This study investigates pH-sensitivity in P1158S, and describes how
physiological pH changes can push P1158S to cause myotonia and periodic paralysis.

<na> Traditionally, muscular channelopathies are classified as either non-dystrophic
myotonias or periodic paralysis (6, 7). Most of these channelopathies are either sporadic de novo
or inherited autosomal dominant mutations (8).

<na> Although this condition is not considered
lethal, it can be extremely life-limiting due to the multitude of muscle contractility problems it can
cause. Given the characteristic hyper-excitability of myotonia, most therapeutics are targeted
against membrane excitability (12–14).

<na> We therefore hypothesized that pH alterations may push P1158S
towards either myotonia or hypoPP.

<a> Overall, during extreme acidosis, at pH6.4, P1158S only displayed the myotonic phenotype (Fig.
8E); however, at the less extreme pH of 7.0, P1158S displayed both myotonia and periodic
paralysis (Fig. 8F). At pH7.4 and pH8.0, P1158S only showed periodic paralysis (Fig. 8G-H).

<na> Periodic paralysis and myotonia represent two life-limiting conditions. Interestingly, they
fall at the opposite extremes of the disease-spectrum caused by Nav1.4-related channelopathies.
P1158S is a single missense mutant that can cause both conditions. We sought to understand how
replacing one amino acid might cause both myotonia and hypoPP.

<a> These simulations predict that during alkalosis,
such as while hyperventilating (51), P1158S can cause periodic paralysis. However, in the
presence of a long stimulus, extreme acidosis can trigger myotonia in P1158S. This is interesting
because it is suggested that a pH decrease in muscle cells could alleviate paralytic attacks in some
patients (52).

<q> Where actin waves have been observed?

<a> Models with actin transport or treadmilling are likely not directly applicable to the
actin waves observed in Dictyostelium [10,11] or immune cells [12], where sequential
cycles of dendritic actin assembly and disassembly are involved [13]. These actin-centric
wave models differ significantly in terms of whether actin provides both positive and
negative feedbacks [14], positive feedbacks alone with an unknown diffusing inhibitor
[15], or negative feedbacks alone with an upstream activator [4].

<na> Actin waves on plasma membrane, which
underlie many important cellular functions [2], are especially intriguing. Many different
models have been proposed for waves of actin, most of which are based on reactiondiffusion
mechanism [3,4] or its variants with additional factors including cytoplasmic
flow [5], myosin-dependent actin transport [6,7] and motor-independent treadmilling
[8,9].

<na> With the increasing interests in the involvement of actin waves
in cellular processes involving membrane morphogenesis, such as cell migration,
spreading and division, membrane geometry becomes an attractive parameter for
modeling [22,23], as well as for experiments [24,25].

<na> Therefore, it is not clear whether similar
mechanisms could apply to actin waves propagating on the ventral surface of the cell,
where membrane protrusion is presumably inhibited by the substrate.

<na> Here we propose a ventral actin wave model in which the waves are
driven by membrane shape undulation and fed back by curvature-dependent biochemical
pathways, instead of driven by protrusive forces generated by actin polymerization.

<na> A number of actin wave models argue that protrusive force driven by actin
polymerization on the membrane is the activating factor for travelling wave formation
[14,26,29]. If the spatial propagation is driven by actin polymerization, wave propagation
speed is expected to be proportional to the actin protrusion velocity, which depends on
the rate of actin polymerization [2].

<na> With low doses of
Latrunculin A (LatA), which prevents actin polymerization by sequestering G-actin, we
observed that in mast cells, the oscillation period increased, but FBP17 waves persisted
with the same propagation speed (Figure 1A).

<na> We determine the dynamical evolution of the system by integrating these equations from
an initial condition: a flat membrane patch (40 µm across) and no cortical proteins. In the
simulation, this membrane patch represents the ventral side of the plasma membrane,
beyond which the model imposes a pinning boundary condition that ramps up a large
resistance force, restoring the membrane height back to baseline, reflecting the hindrance
effect of the cell edge, as the traveling wave in our system is observed on the cell ventral
side.

<na> Our findings identify a
distinct role of membrane curvature in mediating collective dynamics of cortical proteins
and provide a molecular framework for integrating membrane mechanics and
biochemical signaling in the context of subcellular pattern formation.

<na> In this mechanical wave model, both types of
curvature (concave and convex) are necessary and they act as positive and negative
feedbacks, respectively.

<q> Is ibuprofen soluble in water?

<a> Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal drug (Fig. 1) used for its anti-inflammatory effects, which has
long been considered as stereotypical ligand for site DS2 (Sudlow et al. 1975). It is almost insoluble
in water, and in ordinary therapeutic quantity is 99% bound and carried in blood plasma through
proteins (Fanali et al. 2012), mostly by human serum albumin.

<na> Human serum albumin possesses multiple binding sites and transports a wide range of ligands
that include the anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen. A complete map of the binding sites of ibuprofen
in albumin is difficult to obtain in traditional experiments, because of the structural adaptability of
this protein in accommodating small ligands.

<na> The calculated
binding affinities exhibit trends which seem to agree with the available experimental data, and
drastically degrade when the ligand is modeled in a protonated (neutral) state, indicating that
ibuprofen associates with albumin preferentially in its charged form.

<na> Thus, ibuprofen might be complexed with albumin in either or both neutral or charged states, and
the assumption that it binds only in deprotonated form needs to be verified. In addition, due to the
presence of a chiral center involving the central carbon atom in the propionic acid moiety (see Fig.
1), ibuprofen has two enantiomers.

<na> Ibuprofen shows a very high affinity for albumin, with measured binding constants up to
2·106 M–1 (Itoh et al. 1997; Rahman et al. 1993), and primarily binds in site DS2, as demonstrated
by competition for binding with the marker ligand diazepam (Kosa et al. 1997).

<na> Ibuprofen was also
found to bind with lower affinity in the DS1 site, but the observed electron density was too weak to
define the conformation and orientation of a binding pose (Ghuman et al. 2005).

<na> Another weak
binding location has been proposed in site FA2 (di Masi et al. 2011), but the exact anchoring
geometry and protonation of ibuprofen is unknown also in this case. Several other spectroscopic
techniques suggested the presence of possible, additional secondary sites in unidentified locations:
the estimate of the binding parameters of ibuprofen to albumin by equilibrium dialysis (Kosa et al.
1997) required a total of 6 sites to fit the experimental data, whereas up to 10 binding modes were
suggested in other cases (Montero et al. 1990; Whitlam et al. 1979).

<na> In
this work, by using a combination of molecular docking, conventional MD simulations and absolute
alchemical free energy calculations, we report predicted bound geometries, protonation state and
affinity for the binding of the pharmaceutically active form of ibuprofen (S–ibuprofen) to human
serum albumin.

<na> The structure of unliganded albumin was obtained from the complex crystallized in the
presence of two ibuprofen molecules (Ghuman et al. 2005), deposited as 2BXG entry in the Protein
Data Bank.

<na> MD simulations were performed for albumin complexed with a single ibuprofen molecule,
either neutral or charged, placed in each of the 38 binding modes previously selected, for a total of
76 runs.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/080440

<q> How many domains has TerL?

<a> TerL contains two domains: a C-terminal nuclease domain of a RNaseH fold
(7,18,35,38,39,41) and an N-terminal ATPase domain of the ASCE (additional strand,
conserved glutamate) superfamily (45). The TerL protein forms a pentameric ring when
bound to the procapsid (35).

<na> However, how TerL binds DNA
during translocation and cleavage is still mysterious. Here we investigate DNA binding
and cleavage using TerL from the thermophilic phage P74-26.

<na> We propose that interactions with the procapsid shell during DNA translocation
conformationally restrict the nuclease domain, inhibiting cleavage; TerL release from the
procapsid upon completion of packaging unlocks the nuclease domains to cleave DNA.

<na> The TerL protein is the catalytic engine of the packaging apparatus, harboring the
two enzymatic activities of the motor: the ATPase that drives DNA translocation, and the
endonuclease that cleaves genome concatemers at both initiation and termination of
packaging (33).

<na> Careful dissection of
TerL structure and mechanism is necessary to discern between competing models for
TerL activity and regulation.

<na> In this model, the nuclease domains are positioned on the
periphery of the TerL ring so that they can use their C-terminal tails to interact with the
portal ring. Because the ATPase domains line inner pore of the ring, this model
suggests that the ATPase domains are the primary point of contact for DNA during DNA
translocation.

<na> Both the isolated ATPase domain (1-256) and full-length P74-26 TerL mutants were
expressed and purified as previously described (52). The nuclease domain (residues
256-485) was subcloned from our previously described pet24a full-length construct and
was overexpressed identically to the above constructs (52).

<na> Native crystals formed in hanging drops containing 20 mg/mL TerL Nuclease domain
mixed 2:1 with buffer containing 0.23 M sodium phosphate monobasic/potassium
phosphate dibasic pH 6.2 and 2.5 M sodium chloride, and 4 mM dTMP.

<na> Other full-length TerL proteins exhibit significant in vitro nuclease activity
(7,37,39,41,67), although DNA-binding activity is undetectable. Therefore both DNA
binding and cleavage can be separately dissected with TerL.

<na> The coincident TerL dependencies of DNA binding and
cleavage activities indicate that these two functions are tightly linked. Moreover, the
steepness of the activity transition suggests that a cooperative process drives both DNA
binding and cleavage.

<q> How was Aae hfq gene cloned?

<a> The Aae hfq gene was cloned via the polymerase incomplete primer extension (PIPE) methodology
(Klock & Lesley, 2009), using an A. aeolicus genomic sample as a PCR template. The T7-based expression
plasmid pET-28b(+) was used, yielding a recombinant protein construct bearing an Nterminal
His6×-tag and a thrombin-cleavable linker preceding the Hfq (Supp Fig S1a, Supp Table S1);
in all, the tag and linker extended the 80-aa native sequence by 20 residues.

<na> Thus, we have cloned, overexpressed, purified, crystallized, and biochemically characterized
Aae Hfq. We have determined the structures of Aae Hfq in space-groups P1 and P6, both to
1.5 Å resolution, and we have discovered nanomolar-scale binding affinities for uridine- and adenosine-rich
RNAs

<na> Co-crystallization with U6 RNA reveals that the outer rim of the Aae Hfq hexamer
features a well-defined binding pocket that is selective for uracil. This Aae Hfq structure, combined
with biochemical and biophysical characterization of the homolog, reveals deep evolutionary conservation
of the lateral RNA-binding mode, and lays a foundation for further studies of Hfq-associated
RNA biology in ancient bacterial phyla.

<na> Aae Hfq has been shown, via immunoprecipitation/deep-sequencing
studies, to partially restore the phenotype of a Salmonella enterica
Hfq knock-out strain, Δhfq (Sittka et al., 2009), but nothing else is known about the RNA-binding
properties of Aae Hfq.

<na> Here, we report the crystal structure and RNA-binding properties of an A. aeolicus Hfq ortholog.
Aae Hfq crystallized in multiple space-groups, with both hexameric and dodecameric assemblies in
the lattices.

<na> Finally, comparative structural analysis reveals that (i) the spatial pattern of Hfq∙∙∙
RNA interatomic contacts, which effectively defines the rim site, is preserved between Aae and E.
coli, and (ii) the residues comprising the Aae Hfq rim site are pre-organized for U–rich RNA binding.

<na> Recombinant Aae Hfq was then purified via immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC),
using a Ni2+–charged iminodiacetic acid–sepharose column with an NGC (BioRad) medium-pressure
liquid chromatography system.

<na> The Aae Hfq sample was
subjected to proteolysis with thrombin, at a 1:600 Hfq:thrombin ratio (by mass), by incubating at 315
K overnight (≈16 h), followed by application to a benzamidine affinity column to remove the thrombin.
To improve sample homogeneity, Aae Hfq was further purified over a preparative-grade gelfiltration
column containing Superdex™ 200 Increase resin; Aae Hfq eluted as a single, well-defined
peak.

<na> Aae Hfq sample purity was generally assayed via SDS-PAGE gels or matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Samples were prepared for
MALDI by diluting 1:4 (v/v) with 0.01% v/v trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and then spotting on a steel
MALDI plate in a 1:1 v/v ratio with a matrix solution (15 mg/ml sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile,
0.05% TFA); this mixture crystallized in situ via solvent evaporation. Mass spectra were acquired on
a Bruker MicroFlex instrument operating in linear, positive-ion mode (25 kV accelerating voltage; 50-
80% grid voltage), and final spectra were the result of averaging at least 50 laser shots. Two sets of
molecular weight calibrants were used for low (4–20 kDa) and high (20–100 kDa) m/z ranges.

<na> Purified Aae Hfq was chemically crosslinked, using formaldehyde, in a so-called ‘indirect’ (vapor
diffusion–based) method (Fadouloglou et al., 2008).

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/064360

<q> Does MlaC bind to lipid tails?

<na> First, a soluble lipid carrier protein such as MlaC can be employed, with a
hydrophobic pocket accepting the lipid tails, protecting them from bulk solvent. This parallels the
mechanism used by the Lol pathway to transport nascent lipoproteins to the outer membrane
(Konovalova and Silhavy, 2015), in which the structurally unrelated protein LolA plays a similar
functional role to MlaC by sequestering lipid modifications during the transport of nascent lipoproteins
across the periplasm.

<a> Due to the limited volume of the hydrophobic cavity and
the lack of head group interactions, we predict that MlaC is capable of binding to a wide range of
diacyl lipids with little head group specificity. In another MlaC-like structure in the PDB (4FCZ), no
ligands were explicitly modeled, but our re-refinement of the deposited coordinates and structure
factors revealed additional electron density in the hydrophobic pocket of this protein (Figures S4E and
S4H, and Table S3), suggestive of a tetra-acyl, cardiolipin-like lipid. The observation of lipid ligands in
MlaC, 2QGU, and 4FCZ support the notion that MlaC and its close homologs are lipid-binding
proteins.

<na> Here we report that members of the
mammalian cell entry (MCE) protein family form structurally diverse hexameric rings and barrels with
a central channel capable of mediating lipid transport.

<na> Here we report the X-ray and EM structures for the three MCE proteins from E. coli. One MCE
protein, MlaD, forms a homo-hexameric ring, is part of a much larger multi-protein complex in the IM,
and interacts with a soluble lipid-carrying protein, which likely serves as an intermediate that shuttles
lipids between transport complexes in the IM and OM.

<na> The distinct
architectures of these MCE proteins suggest multiple strategies for moving lipids through the
hydrophilic environment of the periplasm.

<na> The two acyl chains of
the lipid insert snugly into the protein core where they are completely protected from solvent in the
protein core (Figure 4C), while the head group is almost entirely solvent exposed and makes only
minor contacts with the protein (Figure 4E).

<na> In order to better understand how these larger MCE domain proteins such as YebT and PqiB
may be involved in lipid transport across the periplasm, we used single-particle cryo EM to obtain a
reconstruction of the PqiB periplasmic domain with an overall resolution of 3.96 Å (Figures S6A -
S6C).

<na> However, in these two regions – between the MCE1 and MCE2 rings, and
between the MCE2 and MCE3 rings – the central pore of PqiB appears to be lined by an 18-stranded β-
barrel motif (Figure 6G), creating a barrier that could exclude solvent from a hydrophobic, lipid
conducting channel (see Method Details in Supporting Information).

<na> These structural data allow us to generate a model for how MCE transport systems traffic lipids
across the periplasm (Figure 7).

<na> Lipid bound MlaC can then
diffuse across the periplasm to the MlaFEDB complex in the IM, where ATP hydrolysis may facilitate
extraction of the lipid from MlaC and/or the translocation of the lipid into the IM.

<q> What was the FDR value in the research?

<a> The false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled at 1% at
the peptide query and protein levels using the q-value approach in the global context, and at
1% peptide query FDR on a sample-by-sample basis.

<na> A description of FDR calculation, and
issues surrounding this, is provided in Supplementary Note 2 and in the accompanying
manuscript.

<a> The total number of proteins detected at 1% FDR over the entire
dataset is 4,984 from 40,304 proteotypic peptide peak groups (Supplementary Table 3). The
median number of proteins detected per file is 4,710 from a median of 34,480 peak groups.
4,077 proteins were detected in >80% of all samples.

<na> Achieving this consistency was dependent on appropriate
FDR control in the global context at both peptide query and protein level. To illustrate this, we
plotted the numbers of peak groups and proteins detected when FDR was controlled only at
peptide query level and not the protein level, and only on a sample-by-sample basis and not in
the global context (Supplementary Fig. 9).

<na> The accumulation of new peak groups steadily
increased across the dataset, indicating a likely accumulation of false positives and, highlighting
the importance of appropriate global FDR control.

<na> The comparison between the protein detection rates from the aggregated analysis and an
individual site-by-site analysis also provides insight into FDR control.

<na> In this analysis, the procedure was identical to that of the
aggregated analysis, except that the global context for FDR control mentioned above was
restricted to the files from an individual site, and that procedure was repeated for each site
individually.

<a> When the data is aggregated
before analysis and FDR control, the higher quality data effectively supports the lower quality
data, because the strict scoring cutoffs required by the 1% protein FDR threshold only needs to
be achieved once per protein in the global context, leading to more homogenous results in terms
of proteins detected.

<na> Appropriate FDR control was key to achieving this result. Extending the FDR control to
the global context (computed over all files in the analysis), in addition to extending the FDR
control from the peptide query to the protein level, were critical in the project where large
numbers of samples were analyzed using a large number of peptide queries.

FTP data exchange; Isabell Bludau for discussions on FDR control; Uwe Schmitt for development
of the PyProphet extension; Hannes Röst for discussions on normalization and data analysis;

<q> Does BRDT interact with nucleosomes via second bromodomain?

<a> We find that BRDT
interacts with nucleosomes through its first (BD1), but not second (BD2) bromodomain, and that
acetylated histone recognition by BD1 is complemented by a novel bromodomain-DNA
interaction.

<na> Bromodomains are critical components of many chromatin modifying/remodeling proteins and
are emerging therapeutic targets, yet how they interact with nucleosomes, rather than acetylated
peptides, remains unclear.

<na> Simultaneous DNA and histone recognition enhances BRDT’s nucleosome binding
affinity, specificity, and ability to localize to and compact acetylated chromatin. Conservation of
DNA binding in bromodomains of BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4, indicates that bivalent nucleosome
recognition is a key feature of these bromodomains and possibly others.

<na> Access is mediated by epigenetic modifications including histone
posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and DNA methylation, which either directly influence
chromatin structure, or recruit or repel chromatin effector proteins that harbor modificationspecific
DNA or histone binding modules, such as bromodomains.

<na> Structure-based alignments and
phylogenetic analysis of the 61 human bromodomains, which are found in 46 diverse proteins,
divides them into eight distinct families.

<na> Bromodomains typically bind to acetylated lysine residues with relatively low affinity
(micromolar) and relatively poor selectivity for single acetylated lysine residues within an
isolated peptide.

<na> The first bromodomain of BRDT (BD1) preferentially binds
histone H4 tail peptides acetylated at lysines 5 and 8 (H4K5acK8ac), whilst the second
bromodomain (BD2) has highest affinity for histone H3 tail peptides acetylated at lysines 18 and
23 (H3K18acK23ac).

<na> Importantly, we
find that the newly identified bromodomain-DNA interaction is non-specific and facilitates
recruitment of BRDT to bulk chromatin, where it can bring about chromatin compaction in
response to histone hyperacetylation in cells.

<na> We speculated that this region
may be responsible for interacting with DNA and may explain the difference in DNA binding
between BD1 and BD2.

<na> In stark contrast to BRDT-BD1, and predictions based on peptide binding studies, we find that
BD2 neither interacts with DNA nor with acetylated nucleosomes. Whereas conservation of the
contiguous positively charged patch on the rest of the BET bromodomains implies conservation
of function, BRDT-BD2 has a considerably more negative electrostatic surface potential.

<q> What does inhibit triggered by the Zika NS2B-NS3pro?

<a> Here, for the first time, we discovered that
quercetin, a flavonoid extensively existing in many fruits and vegetables, effectively
inhibits Zika NS2B-NS3pro.

<na> As facilitated by our previous studies on Dengue NS2B-NS3pro (12), we started to
work on Zika NS2B-NS3pro immediately after the outbreak of Zika and now successfully
obtained several active forms of recombinant Zika NS2B-NS3pro.

<a> Here we release the result that quercetin, a flavonoid existing in
many fruits and vegetables, inhibits Zika NS2B-NS3pro, and subsequently determined its
inhibitory activity.

<na> The Zika NS2B-NS3pro we obtained is fully active as judged from its enzymatic
activity on a fluorescent substrate Bz-nKRR-AMC (12).

<a> When Zika
NS2B-NS3pro at 50 nM (Fig 1C) was pre-incubated with quercetin at different
concentrations, the enzymatic activity was inhibited at a dose-dependent manner (Fig 2A),
indicating that quercetin is an inhibitor of Zika NS2B-NS3pro.

<a> It is
interesting to find that quercetin acts as a non-competitive inhibitor for Zika NS2B-NS3pro.
This clearly suggests that quercetin is an allosteric inhibitor which binds to the site having no
direct overlap with the substrate binding pocket of Zika NS2B-NS3pro.

<na> It has been recently estimated that one-third of the world
population will be infected by Zika in the near future, but unfortunately so far there is
no vaccine or medicine for Zika.

<na> Zika virus was originally isolated from a sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of
Uganda in 1947 (1), which is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes. Since
2007, large epidemics of Asian genotype Zika virus have been reported around the world (2-
4).

<na> Most seriously, Zika infection has been found to be associated with
serious sequelae such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, and microcephaly in newborn infants of
mothers infected with Zika virus during pregnancy (6-9), and consequently WHO has
declared a public health emergency for Zika virus (10).

<na> Zika virus represents a significant
challenge to the public health of the whole world but unfortunately there is no effective
vaccine or other therapy available so far.

<q> In which order and bond forming follow in SN2?

<a> For a typical SN2 reaction, the event of bond breaking and bond forming occurs
synchronously, forming a pseudo penta-coordinate transition state (TS) in which both
nucleophile and leaving group are partially bonded to the central transferred group.

<na> SN2 substitution represents an important class of reaction for
both chemical and biological systems. The ability to assess enzymatic transition
state structure within this class of reaction remains a major experimental challenge.

<na> In a recent work, Williams and coworkers
carried out DFT calculations on a simplified model reaction to understand the
influence of carbon to oxygen hydrogen bonds (CH···O) on the magnitude of rates
and kinetic isotope effects (KIE) in enzymatic methyl transfer reactions.

<na> Their (simplified) methyl transfer model contains a
methyl cation surrounded by two axial water molecules and three equatorial water
molecules; these water molecules mimic the donor-acceptor interaction along the axis
of reaction (referred to as axial interactions) and the hydrogen bonding interaction
between the transferred CH3 and hydrogen bonding functional groups in an
orthogonal plane (referred to as equatorial interactions).

<na> The
latter is concluded to play a limited role in determining relative reaction rates and
secondary KIEs derived from experimental structure- activity correlations.

<na> Understanding and predicting chemical reactivity remains one of the central tasks of
molecular science. Much attention has been focused on the properties of reactants and,
in particular, the concept of “structure-reactivity relationships” whereby changes in
structure lead to changes in reactivity.

<na> As described by Trievel and coworkers,[4] CH···O hydrogen bonding interactions
between active site side chains and the activated methyl group of AdoMet are
predicted to influence reaction outcomes within the family of AdoMet -dependent
methyltransferases.

<na> To conclude, the recent study of Williams et al. has illustrated the powerful potential
of computation to assess a proposed role for C-H to oxygen interactions in modulating
rate and TS structure for enzymatic methyl transfer reactions.

<na> The relationship between the compactness of reaction center and the
secondary KIE is currently at an empirical stage. It is expected that rigorous
mathematical analysis will be forthcoming in the future developments.

<na> Determination of this TS
structure is key to elucidating the reaction mechanism and has received an enormous
amount of attention.

<q> Does ETS1-p42 autoinhibit?

<a> The ETS1 splice variant, ETS1-p42, lacks an exon that
encodes a crucial part of the autoinhibitory module. Thus, ETS1-p42 does not autoinhibit. We showed
that the absence of autoinhibition allows ETS1Δ335, an N-terminal deletion that recapitulates the DNAbinding
of , to form homodimers in the absence of DNA. However, ETS1-p42 is thought to bind
its DNA sites only as monomers.

<na> However, ETS1-p42 is thought to bind
its DNA sites only as monomers. Here, we explore this paradox and show that ETS1Δ335 binds
cooperatively to DNA containing two EBSs.

<na> Finally, we show that DNA acts catalytically to separate unbound ETS1Δ335 dimers
into monomers. Together, these results suggest a model of ETS1-p42 DNA-binding, where ETS1-p42 can
bind to a single EBS with 2:1 stoichiometry.

<a> A major splice variant of ETS1, termed ETS1-p42, lacks exon VII that encodes the N-terminal
inhibitory domain. As a result, ETS1-p42 is not autoinhibited. This indicates that the NTD is crucial for
ETS1 autoinhibition.

<na> ETS1-p42 reportedly binds to a head-to-head site containing two EBSs in the
promoter for the matrix metalloproteinase MMP3 (12,14). However, despite the presence of two EBSs,
ETS1-p42 apparently binds as a monomer to the MMP3 promoter, whereas the full-length ETS1-p51
variant seemingly binds this sequence only as a homodimer.

<na> Furthermore, despite
binding as an apparent monomer, ETS1-p42 needs both EBSs to drive expression from an MMP3-
luciferase reporter construct (14,19). To date these contradictions have not been explored.

<na> Taken together, these findings raise a number of important questions. Does ETS1-p42 bind DNA
as a monomer? If so, why are multiple EBSs needed for ETS1-p42 transcriptional activation?
Furthermore, if a consequence of losing autoinhibition is ETS1-p42 self-association in the absence of
DNA, what regions of the protein are responsible for mediating this self-association?

<a> In this study, we
find that despite its inability to autoinhibit, ETS1-p42 binds cooperatively to a promoter sequence
containing two EBSs. Additionally, footprinting results indicate that two ETS1-p42 proteins bind the
MMP3 promoter, potentially explaining the necessity for both EBSs to drive expression.

<na> Finally, we show
that in the absence of an intact autoinhibitory module, ETS1-p42 appears to interact with DNA in a
fashion where DNA induces a rearrangement of a free ETS1-p42 dimer into a monomer that is
competent to bind DNA.

<na> When assayed in vitro, two of the three reported splice variants of ETS1, ETS1-
p51 and ETS1-p42, display essentially identical DNA binding preferences (26,27). However, ETS1-p51 and
ETS1-p42 have different gene regulatory activities in vivo (28).

<q> Where is Ku70 more abundant after thermal stress?

<a> Of note, DNA damage response proteins Ku70 and Ku80
are more abundant in the vicinity of lamin A/C after thermal stress. This increased affinity also
applies to the progerin isoform, potentially contributing to the premature aging phenotype of
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

<na> Additionally, we found
progerin to preferentially bind Ku70 and
Ku80, for which progerin binding was not
previously reported (Supplementary
Dataset).

<na> Finally, we showed
that heat shock, a form of proteotoxic stress,
but not genotoxic stress, drives Ku70 and
Ku80 to the NE (Supplementary Dataset).

<a> We focused
on DNA-PKcs and its regulatory subunits
Ku70 and Ku80, and showed that heat shock
drives both subunits, but not DNA-PKcs, to
associate with lamin A/C.

<na> While no
progeroid syndromes resulting from DNAPKcs
mutations have been reported in
humans, deletion of DNA-PKcs, Ku70 or
Ku80 causes premature aging in mice.

<na> Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) show that for Ku70 and Ku80, but not DNA-PKcs, fluorescence
intensity increases after bleaching of lamin A/C adjacent fluorophores. FRET efficiency was 0 for DNA-PKcs, 0.34 for Ku70 and 0.15 for
Ku80. We note that negative FRET results, as is the case for DNA-PKcs, cannot be interpreted as a lack of interaction.

<na> . By contrast, as the
signal from the NE decays with distance,
abundant proteins that are labeled due to
signal leakage will be underrepresented in
the bound compared to the unbound
fraction.

<na> To improve on these results, we sought to
increase signal intensity. Reaction time
determines the labeling radius and signal
intensity.

<na> We compared our BAR results to that
obtained from six other methods. These
datasets were generated by various
biochemical and genetic methods applied to
different cell lines and yeast.

<na> An underlying assumption of cell culture
usage is that it mimics to a significant extent
relevant processes that occur throughout the
entire organism.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/065508

<q> Is myosin motor domain conserved?

<a> In the course of our studies, we observed that a relatively flat surface of the myosin motor
domain, which we named the myosin mesa, is nearly completely conserved in all cardiac species
from mouse α-cardiac myosin to human β-cardiac myosin (33), which is not true of other
surfaces of the catalytic domain.

<na> The data presented here provide experimental support for the myosin mesa hypothesis (33),
which submits that the highly-conserved mesa is a hotspot for HCM mutations that are
predominantly weakening the stability of a sequestered complex involving interactions of the
mesa with either the myosin S2 tail and/or MyBP-C, resulting in more myosin heads becoming
available for interaction with actin, causing the hyper-contractility observed clinically.

<na> L. Alamo et al., Conserved intramolecular interactions maintain myosin interacting-heads motifs
explaining tarantula muscle super-relaxed state structural basis. J Mol Biol, (2016).

<na> The conservation of residues on the mesa holds up when comparing fast
skeletal myosin with cardiac myosin (both muscle types have MyBP-C), while the conservation
is lost when comparing smooth muscle myosin or non-muscle myosin II with cardiac myosin
(neither smooth muscle or non-muscle cells have MyBP-C) (33).

<na> Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most commonly occurring inherited cardiovascular
disease, is primarily caused by mutations in human β-cardiac myosin and myosin binding
protein-C.

<na> We consider a model involving three types of interactions involving the myosin
mesa and the converter domain of the myosin motor that hold myosin heads in a sequestered
state, likely to be released in a graded manner as the demands on the heart increase: 1) the two
myosin heads binding to one another, 2) one head binding to its own coiled-coil tail, and 3) the
other head binding to myosin binding protein-C.

<na> We show that these interactions are weakened as a result of
myosin HCM mutations, in a manner consistent with our structural model. Our data suggests a
potential unifying hypothesis for the molecular basis of hyper-contractility caused by human
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myosin mutations, whereby the mutations give rise to an increase
in the number of myosin heads that are functionally accessible for interaction with actin in the
sarcomere, causing the hyper-contractility observed clinically.

<na> About half of all patients suffering from HCM are found to have
mutations in genes encoding cardiac sarcomeric proteins, predominantly human β-cardiac
myosin (~40%), myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) (~40%) and the regulated thin filament
system consisting of the actin-tropomyosin-troponin complex (~10%)(3, 4, 6-9).

<na> In the case of R403Q human β-cardiac myosin, the maximum actinactivated
ATPase was increased only 30% compared to the 2.3-fold increase seen with the
mouse α-cardiac myosin (11), velocity was increased only 15%, and the Fintrinsic actually
decreased by 20% (16) (Table 1).

<na> It was previously proposed that the myosin mesa on the globular S1 head of human β-cardiac
myosin might interact with its own S2 coiled-coil tail and/or with myosin binding protein-C
(MyBP-C), sequestering the myosin heads in a state that is not accessible for interaction with
actin (33).

<q> Did shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics identify Zika protein in samples?

<a> Shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics did
not identify any Zika protein in all samples. However, MS detected the presence of
peptide(s) from the polyprotein of a Bovine-like viral diarrhea virus (BVDV-like) in
Zika-positive brains.

<na> No direct experimental causal evidence confirms that the Zika virus is the sole
etiological agent responsible for the development of brain malformations in human
fetuses during pregnancy.

<na> In January 2016, Melo suggested a correlation between Zika infection and fetal
microcephaly during a two case study of women living in Paraiba State who complained
of symptoms of Zika virus infection during pregnancy; real time PCR confirmed the
presence of Zika virus in children brain tissue and amniotic fluid (3).

<na> Here, we expand these findings using discovery-driven shotgun
proteomics based on high resolution and accuracy mass spectrometry analysis to show
the detection of a BVDV-like virus in tissue extracts of Zika positive brains.

<na> Some questions are still unanswered as the association between Zika virus and
microcephaly and the presence of others etiological agents. Therefore, we used a
discovery-driven approach based on shotgun proteomics to acquire a comprehensive
proteome of three microcephalic brains.

<na> This approach robustly identified polypeptides
from Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV). Interestingly, this strategy did not identify
any Zika virus polypeptide. Afterwards, we repeated the search, now against a database
containing combined virus and human entries downloaded from UniProt (April_2016).

<na> These
characteristics make a BVDV-like pestivirus a possible co-infecting agent acting
together with Zika virus for the development of congenital malformations. Human
fetuses with microcephaly show similar lesions (5, 7).

<na> In conclusion, our data made us to suspect that Zika virus may not be the sole
etiological agent present in brains of fetuses born with microcephaly. In fact, the data
raises the suspicion that another agent possessing similar structural features and
properties to BVDV might induce the same anomalies to animal and human fetuses.

<na> BVDV is an enveloped pestivirus in the family Flaviviridae with a single strand RNA
genome of positive polarity, approximately 12.5 kb in size containing a single open
reading frame flanked by two non-translating regions named 5´and 3-UTR. The single
translated polypeptide chain generates 10 - 12 mature viral proteins, structural and
nonstructural. Pathological lesions in animals caused by BVDV infections vary in type
and degree and consequently promote wide pathogenesis including congenital defects.

<na> Animal and herd infection by BVDV in the State of Paraíba, Brazil have been reported.
Spatial hierarchical variances and age co-variances for seroprevalence to BVDV
sampled from 2343 cattle from 72 properties showed seroprevalence to BVD at 22.2 %
strongly clustered within herds and positively correlated between young and
replacement age groups within herds.

<q> How ubiquitin (Ub) is activated?

<na> Activated interphase cell cycle extracts, made using the general protocol illustrated in (Figure 1),
were first developed by Manfred Lohka in the lab of Yoshio Masui using Rana pipiens cytosol to study
pronuclear formation with Xenopus laevis sperm nuclei [16, 17].

<na> Extracts that could go through multiple cell cycles were also developed [21, 22].
In addition, non-activated or cytostatic factor (CSF)-arrested meiotic metaphase extracts have been
generated, replicating the environment of the mitosis-like state of unfertilized egg and these could later
be activated and driven into interphase with the addition of calcium ([23], with further refinements [24]).

<a> In brief, Ub is activated by an E1 enzyme [36], passed to an
Ub-conjugating (E2) enzyme [37] and from there to a substrate protein, specified by the particular E3
ligase that binds both the substrate and the E2 [38].

<na> By adding c-Mos protein to CSF-arrested egg extracts, the authors
found that the cyclin degradation machinery was poised, but not inactivated, as release of the extract
from the CSF block by addition of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II allowed the degradation
machinery to function normally.

<na> The small protein modifier, ubiquitin, can be covalently attached to proteins in the process of ubiquitylation,
resulting in a variety of functional outcomes. In particular, the most commonly-associated and
well-studied fate for proteins modified with ubiquitin is their ultimate destruction: degradation by the
26S proteasome via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, or digestion in lysosomes by proteolytic enzymes.

<na> Biochemical studies of ubiquitin and protein degradation using this system have led to significant
advances particularly in the study of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, while the versatility of Xenopus
as a developmental model has allowed investigation of the in vivo consequences of ubiquitylation.

<na> Here we are focusing on its use in the study of proteolysis, where the
simplicity of the ubiquitylation and degradation assays that the extract system allows has been key to
the significant advances that have resulted (see [30, 31, 32] for examples of Ub protocols).

<na> The polyUb modification most commonly understood to target
proteins for UPS-mediated degradation is a tetramer of K48-linked Ub moieties [39].

<na> It was observed that a purified cell-cycle dependent component of
the ubiquitylation machinery, the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) (see below), from
Xenopus extract at different salt conditions, could bring about the formation of Ub chains of differing
lengths.

<na> Global Ub metabolism is not obviously regulated by the cell cycle; using cycling Xenopus egg extract,
it was possible to show that the levels of Ub did not change with the cell cycle phase; the rates of conjugation,
protein degradation, and isopeptidase activity all remained constant throughout the course of the
cycling extract experiments [44].

<q> What is magnetotactic bacteria?

<a> Magnetotactic bacteria assemble
iron-based magnetic crystals called magnetosomes
into chains within their cells allowing them to
passively align in and navigate along magnetic
fields(1, 2).

<a> Magnetotactic bacteria are aquatic organisms that produce subcellular magnetic particles in
order to orient in the earth’s geomagnetic field.

<na> Two of these, mamE and mamO, encode predicted
trypsin-like proteases required to produce
magnetite in the model magnetotactic organism,
Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1(6).

<na> Biochemical principles underlying the
biomineralization of magnetite by magnetotactic
bacteria represent a model for understanding how
biological molecules manipulate inorganic
compounds(43).

<na> MamE, a predicted HtrA protease required to produce
magnetite crystals in the magnetotactic bacterium Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1, was recently
shown to promote the proteolytic processing of itself and two other biomineralization factors in vivo.

<na> For MamO, a full-length and a
shorter band were observed for both the N- and Cterminally
tagged proteins, predicting an internal
MamE-dependent cleavage site resulting in two
stable fragments (Fig. 1B).

<q> How hear stability of AGPases was tested?

<a> Aliquots of
cell-free extracts of the wild type and mutant AGPases were placed in a water bath at
65°C for 5 and 10 min and then cooled on ice.

<na> Finally,
the LSE370GSSWTAGPase is less heat stable compared with the WT AGPase.
Computational analysis of the mutant Gly-370 in the 3D modeled LS AGPase showed
that this residue changes charge distribution of the surface and thus affect stability of the
LS AGPase and overall heat stability of the heterotetrameric AGPase. In summary, our
results show that LSE370 intricately modulate the heat stability and enzymatic activity of
the AGPase.

<na> Manipulation of the AGPase activity and its heat stability gets much attention in
increasing the starch yield of plants because it catalyzes the first committed step as well
as the rate limiting step of starch biosynthesis [19-22].

<na> Modulating the heat stability is
especially important for cereal AGPases because elevated temperature is a major
environmental factor that greatly reduces grain yield and seed weight [23, 24].

<na> Thermal stability of the enzyme has been shown to not only depend on the robustness of
the LS-SS interactions but also on the binding of the effector molecules to the allosteric
sites [23, 26, 27].

<na> AGPase is not
well defined. In this study, we demonstrated that an amino acid (LSE370), close to the LS
interface, is important for maintaining the heat stability of the heterotetrameric structure
of the AGPase.

<na> AGPase was
solvated in a rectangular box with TIP3P water molecules having a minimum of 10Å
distance from the closest atom of the protein to the boundary, and then counter ions were
added to neutralize the system. Initially only the side chains were minimized for 10000
steps. Subsequently all atoms were minimized for 10000 steps without pressure control.
Then the system was heated up to 310K by increasing the temperature 10K and 10ps
simulation was performed at each step.

<a> Finally we investigated the heat stability of our mutant AGPases by using the recently
developed HOTMUSIC tool which predicts melting temperature changes as a result of
point mutations [6]. HOTMUSIC analysis indicated that both mutations cause protein to
adopt lower Tm which means decrease in the heat stability (Table 1).

<na> AGPase significantly impairs 3PGA binding but does
not change the heat stability. Those together with our results, which reveal the
contribution of Glu370 for the heat stability, substrate and effector binding properties,
specify the importance of this residue for the structure-function relationship of AGPase.

<na> In conclusion, our results show that LSE370 intricately modulate the heterotetrameric
assembly, heat stability and enzymatic activity of the AGPase.

<q> What is cryo-EM resolution?

<a> Cryo-EM has revealed many challenging yet exciting macromolecular assemblies
at near-atomic resolution (3-4.5Å), providing biological phenomena with
molecular descriptions.

<a> Advances in direct electron detectors as well as better image analysis algorithms
have led cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to achieve near-atomic resolution
(3-4.5 Å) using single-particle analysis [1-3].

<na> Cryo-EM reconstructions at these
resolutions, where individual β-strands are resolvable, and bulky sidechains are
somewhat visible, make it possible to build an all-atom model directly from such
maps.

<na> In this manuscript, we develop a three-stage approach for automatically refining
manually traced cryo-EM models (Figure 1). While previously we have developed
an iterative local rebuilding tool capable of refining homology models into nearatomic-resolution
cryo-EM maps.

<na> Our approach adopts and
improves upon our previous work on refining cryo-EM structures from distant
homology structures [11], in which a similar fragment-based backbone rebuilding
strategy is employed.

<na> Moreover, when the previous approach was applied to the de novo handtraced
models from cryo-EM maps, we observed that – following all-atom
refinement – in incorrect regions, the models still fit the density well, but did so by
introducing strain in the nearby bond angles and torsions.

<na> Using a training dataset composed of error-containing models of a
cryo-EM map in which the structure has been determined by X-ray
crystallography (Supplemental Figure 2), we show that the new error predictor
offers better discrimination of incorrectly versus correctly placed backbone, with
an AUPRC (area under precision-recall curve) of 0.80 versus 0.76 using density
alone (Supplemental Figure 2).

<na> To compensate for this, we downweigh the
contributions of sidechains which are less resolved in cryo-EM density. Downweighing
factors for each amino acid were determined by comparing the average
per-amino-acid real-space B-factor on two cryo-EM reconstructions with known
high-resolution crystal structures (20S proteasome [1] and β-galactosidase [16]),

<na> The voxel size of a cryo-EM reconstruction is determined
by the physical pixel size on the detector scaled by a magnification factor.
However, the magnification factor may be determined with some inaccuracy,
leading to errors in deciding the voxel size of the resulting single-particle
reconstruction.

<a> We first applied our new refinement approach to the
recently determined 3.4-Å cryo-EM reconstruction of the TRPV1 channel in the
apo form [12].

<q> What was used to experimetally prove the fibril formation rate expressions?

<a> To experimentally validate the fibril formation rate expressions,
we use data from two studies, 34,35 where the formation and elongation
of Aβ fibrils was probed by monitoring the increase in ThT
fluorescence intensity as a function of time.

<na> Fragmentation and
other molecular events, such as inhibition, and off-pathway aggregation,
have been predicted to contribute significantly to the
lag phase of fibril formation.

<na> A major
challenge is determining which molecular events regulate the
lag phase in fibril formation. 10 There has been much debate on
whether nucleation, growth, or both contribute to the lag phase
of the sigmoidal-shaped curve.

<na> Protein folding is vital to normal functioning of the cell. While
most proteins have one or more native conformations, some proteins
misfold into a non-native conformation, causing accumulation
and ultimately the formation of amorphous aggregates, or
in the case of amyloidogenic proteins, mature amyloid fibrils.

<na> The progress curve of fibrils or aggregates typically takes on a sigmoidal shape with
a lag phase, a rapid growth phase, and a final plateau regime. The study of the lag phase and
the estimation of its critical timescale provide insight into the factors regulating the fibrillation process.

<na> We show that the lag time is given by the
sum of the critical timescales for each fibril intermediate in the subsequent monomer addition
mechanism and therefore reveals causal connectivity between intermediate species. Furthermore,
we find that single-molecule assays of protein fibrillation can exhibit a lag phase without a
nucleation process, while dyes and extrinsic fluorescent probe bulk assays of protein fibrillation
do not exhibit an observable lag time phase during template-dependent elongation.

<na> Fibrillogenesis is a
complex multistep process, generally beginning with monomers
or other small molecules that collide and bond to form larger
molecules including oligomers and protofibrils, until the fibril
sizes formed have reached equilibrium.

<na> The equilibrium fibril
size distribution can vary from strongly skewed distributions to
broad distributions depending on a number of factors, including
elapsed time, fragmentation effects, and aggregate merging.

<na> ThT fluorescence intensity is not an
absolute measure of the amount of protein fibrils formed because
multiple ThT molecules bind to multiple species, including pre-
fibrillar oligomers and fibrils of differing sizes.

<na> For example,
Horrocks et al. 16 developed a technique called Single Aggregate

<q> Where to find cDNA of Hook3?

<a> The cDNA of Hook3 was obtained from a human cDNA library made from mitotic RPE-1 cells,
and all Hook3 constructs were cloned into vector pET28a with an N-terminal 6x His-strepIIsuperfolder
GFP (sfGFP) tag.

<na> Metazoan cytoplasmic dynein moves processively along microtubules with the aid of dynactin
and an adaptor protein that joins dynein and dynactin into a stable ternary complex. Here, we
have examined how Hook3, a cargo adaptor involved in Golgi and endosome transport, forms a
motile dynein-dynactin complex.

<na> Our work reveals the structural details of Hook3’s interaction with dynein and offers insight into
how cargo adaptors form processive dynein-dynactin motor complexes.

<na> One cargo adaptor that has been shown to assemble and activate dynein-dynactin is Hook3,
although its mechanism has been less studied compared to BicD2.

<na> Here, we sought to understand the mechanism by which Hook3 interacts with dynein and
dynactin and activates processive motility. We report the crystal structure of the Hook domain
and show that this domain binds directly to the C-terminal region of LIC1.

<na> Abrogation of the LIC interaction renders Hook3 unable to join dynein and dynactin
into a stable complex. Interestingly, while the N-terminal 239 residues of Hook3 are sufficient for
forming a stable complex with dynein-dynactin, this tripartite complex is immotile; activation of
motility requires a more distal coiled coil region of Hook3.

<na> Hook3 is comprised of the N-terminal, highly conserved “Hook” domain (Walenta et al., 2001),
followed by three coiled coils and a C-terminal cargo-binding region (Fig. 1 A). A yeast twohybrid
assay revealed an interaction between aa 1-236 of C. elegans Hook and the LIC (Malone
et al., 2003).

<na> After adding wild-type or Hook3 mutants to the
lysate followed by the Hook3 pulldown, we found that the single point mutants Q147A and I154A
bound very little or no dynein and no detectable dynactin, whereas the M151A mutant bound
dynein-dynactin in a similar manner to wild-type (Fig. 4 B, Fig. S4 D).

<na> Lengthening the coiled coil domain from residue 239 to
552 did not significantly change the amount of dynein that is pulled down with Hook3 from the
brain lysate (Fig. 5 B, Fig. S5 A). However, lengthening the coiled coil resulted in a progressive
increase in the amount of interacting dynactin (Fig. 5 B, Fig. S5 A).

<na> Our work provides structural insights into how Hook3 binds to dynein. We previously found that
the C-terminal half of LIC1 is the docking site for several cargo adaptors (Schroeder et al.,
2014), and we show here that Hook3 binds to this same region of the LIC. Helix H, which
extends from the CH domain, plays a key role in the LIC interaction, and our structure-function
studies reveal two patches of residues in helix H (I136/I139/M142 and Q147/I154) that are
involved in the interaction.

<q> Is ATP binding pocket of protein kinases conserved?

<a> However, this strategy is often undermined by
a lack of selectivity since the ATP binding pocket that kinase inhibitors usually
target is highly conserved. Inhibitors that target allosteric sites are more
selective but more difficult to generate.

<na> d. IgNARV-D01 makes contacts with both lobes of
Aurora-A, but does not closely approach the ATP binding pocket. The interface is
centered on the αC-helix within the N-lobe of Aurora-A. This helix within the
kinase fold bears residues that are critical for catalysis and is often the site of
interactions with regulatory binding partners as exemplified by the complex of
Cyclin-A/CDK2, and TPX2/Aurora-A (Figure 2B).

<a> Most current kinase inhibitors target the ATP binding site, which is relatively
straightforward to block with small molecules (1). However, this site is also
highly conserved among all protein kinases and therefore many inhibitors have
off-target effects.

<na> MLN8054 and IgNARVD01
both stabilise a distortion in the αC-helix that disrupts the Lys-Glu saltbridge
by moving the side chain of Glu181 away from the ATP binding site. The
distortion of the αC-helix is coupled to a shift in the position of the side chain of
Phe275, which fills the space vacated by Glu181 (Fig. 5B, C).

<na> Here we identify a single domain
antibody (nanobody) to target an allosteric pocket on the catalytic domain of
Aurora-A kinase and demonstrate that the mechanism is antagonistic to a
physiologically-relevant allosteric activator, TPX2.

<na> All three variable regions of IgNARV-D01 contact the
kinase surface: Asp33 from CDR1 forms a salt-bridge with Arg179 (Aurora-A
αC); residues 48-49 of HV2 contact the N-terminus of αE; Ile52 of HV2 makes
side and main-chain interactions with the activation loop sequence Val279-
His280-Ala281; the side-chains of CDR3 residues Ile87 and Trp91 insert into a
hydrophobic pocket formed between αC and β4, and the Trp91 side-chain makes
a H-bond with Glu175 side-chain within this pocket (Figure 3A).

<na> IgNARV-D01 inserts Trp91 into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the αC-helix
and strand β4 of Aurora-A. This pocket plays an important role in the regulation
of Aurora-A by TPX2 and, more generally in the regulation of AGC and related
kinases, through binding of a peptide bearing a hydrophobic motif (34).

<na> This regulatory, hydrophobic
pocket presents an attractive target for the rational development of allosteric
kinase inhibitors. Indeed, the equivalent hydrophobic (PIF) pocket of PDK1 has
successfully been targeted by small molecules, both directly and by tethering
approaches (6-8).

<na> In addition,
Asn36 and Tyr38 from βC interacts with the αC-helix through a H-bond with the
side-chain of Glu183 (and Van der Waals contact with the side-chain of His187).
These interactions are mostly conserved between the two crystal forms of the
complex, with the exception of the contacts between HV2 and activation loop.

<na> It therefore seems likely the
conserved features of these structures represent a physiologically relevant
conformation of Aurora-A, one of many that may exist when the kinase is in a
dynamic state, which can be captured by ligands or IgNARV-D01.

<q> What is virion radius of HIV-1?

<a> Capsid assembly is critical for HIV-1 infectivity. However, capsid destruction is also
crucial to the viral lifecycle: successful infection is sensitive to the specific time at which a
capsid uncoats after cell entry, with both premature and delayed uncoating detrimental to
viral replication 6,42. Assuming virion radius ≈ 630 Å 24, the transfer of virion contents into a
cell of radius ≈ 10 μm 43 produces a rapid dilution of the CA solution around the capsid.

<a> Controlled study of HIV-1 capsid assembly is complicated by the inherent variability
of virions: non-trivial differences in the average radius (≈ 630 ± 50 Å) and Gag content (≈
2400 ± 700 molecules) are reported in vivo 24-26, and these values bound a significant
potential range of CA concentrations.

<na> Given suitable
conditions in vitro, CA can spontaneously self-assemble into a wide variety of structures 11-
18, but the prototypical mature virion contains a single conical capsid with a complex of
viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein (NC) condensed within the broader terminus. In
agreement with fullerene cone models 14, pentameric and hexameric CA oligomers have
been identified as the basic components of mature-style CA lattice, with CA NTDs arranged
into quasi-equivalent rings, 15,19-21 and with pentamers believed be present in regions of
higher local curvature in the capsid lattice.
21,22 Although the NTD and CTD structures of CA
are well conserved, a flexible inter-domain linker region allows CA in solution to
dynamically transition between conformations that are compatible and incompatible with
mature lattice 23.

<na> Molecular crowding effects are known to influence protein behaviours 29 and yet,
remarkably, virion maturation consistently produces similar capsid morphologies. The
relatively fast maturation process 30,31 makes in vivo study of capsid self-assembly
pathways difficult.

<na> As the average virion contains approximately twice the CA present in a mature
capsid, a capsid exists in equilibrium with a relatively high concentration of solution-state
CA.

<na> CGMD simulations were performed (see Methods and Supporting Information
Fig. SI 1A-C) using CA concentrations [CA] of 1 mM, 2 mM, 3 mM, and 4 mM (with [CA] in a
typical virion estimated as ≈ 3.8 mM).

<na> Total non-lipid mass density of HIV-1 virions
was estimated as ≈ 200 to 300 mg/mL 24, and so the CG model self-assembly initiated at
mass density levels comparable to the virion.

<na> Lamellar and off-pathway capsid structures are indicated to be
significantly more common in virion systems lacking RNA/NC complex,40 as is the case in
these CG simulations.

<na> This avoids the use of a single model structure, whose natural stability may
differ subtly under different test conditions even in the absence of rapid dilution..These
simulations therefore probe the effects of rapid dilution specifically, representing a
cytoplasmic environment that is otherwise identical to the notional virion in which the
structures were generated.

<na> It is interesting to consider HIV-1 virion maturation in light of these results.
Although the prototypical mature virion contains a single capsid, multiple capsid structures
are sometimes observed 9,31-33,53, both with and without RNA/NC encapsulation 32,
suggesting a delicate balance in the virion. Multiple capsids appear correlated with larger
virions 33,53, consistent with sensitivity of CG assembly to local conditions: lattice growth
reduces capsid protein in solution, so larger virions (with larger numbers CA for the same
overall CA concentration) could maintain CA levels above a critical nucleating value for
longer periods after an initial lattice region forms.

<d> What is exosome?

<q> Exosomes are a subclass of extracellular vesicle which can be defined as 30-100
µm vesicles with a buoyant density of ~1.10-1.19 g/ml that are enriched in specific
biochemical markers, including tetraspanin proteins (Colombo et al., 2014).

<a> Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted from metazoan cells and may convey
selected membrane proteins and small RNAs to target cells for the control of cell
migration, development and metastasis.

<na> Using immunoisolated
CD63-containing exosomes we identified a set of microRNAs that are highly enriched
with respect to their cellular levels. To explore the biochemical requirements for exosome
biogenesis and RNA packaging, we devised a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the
species-selective enclosure of miR-223 in isolated membranes supplemented with cytosol.

<na> Numerous studies have
reported the presence of RNAs, especially microRNAs, from fractions containing
exosomes, though many of these studies have relied on isolation techniques (e.g. high
speed sedimentation) that do not resolve vesicles from other cellular debris or RNPs
(Bobrie, Colombo, Krumeich, Raposo, & Thery, 2012).

<na> Even with the crude preparations that have been characterized, it is clear that
RNA profiles from exosomes are distinct from those of the producer cells. Thus RNA
capture or stabilization in exosomes is likely to occur through a selective sorting
mechanism.

<na> In order to probe the mechanism of exosome biogenesis, we developed
procedures to refine the analysis of RNA sorting into exosomes. Using traditional means
of membrane fractionation and immunoisolation, we identified unique miRNAs highly
enriched in exosomes marked by their content of CD63.

<na> Among the requirements for miRNA sorting in vitro,
we found one RNA-binding protein, YBX1, which is a known constituent of exosomes
secreted from intact cells (Buschow et al., 2010; Ung, Madsen, Hellwinkel, Lencioni, &
Graner, 2014).

<a> We first sought to purify exosomes from other extracellular vesicles and contaminating
particles containing RNA (e.g. aggregates, ribonucleoprotein complexes) that sediment at
high speed. We define exosomes as ~30-100 nm vesicles with a density of 1.08-1.18 g/ml
and containing the tetraspanin protein CD63.

<na> Finally, sucrose gradient fractions were mixed with CD63 antibody-immobilized
beads to recover vesicles enriched in this exosome marker protein.

<na> Using isolated exosome fractions, we confirmed that the CD63-
luciferase fusion maintained the expected topology. Luciferase activity was stimulated by
the addition of detergent to disrupt the membrane and allow access to the membrane
impermeable substrates luciferin and ATP, and to trypsin, which inactivated luciferase
activity in the presence but not in the absence of detergent (Figure 1f).

<na> We obtained a total of
58,848 miRNA reads in the exosome library representing 444 distinct miRNAs and
511,555 reads representing 549 miRNAs in the cell library (Figure 2a).

<q> What activates ExoY within host target cells?

<a> Here we demonstrate that filamentous actin (F-actin) is the hitherto
unknown co-factor that activates P. aeruginosa ExoY within host target cells. Highly
purified actin, when polymerized into filaments, potently stimulates (>10,000 fold) ExoY
activity.

<na> We further show that actin also activates an ExoY-like adenylate
cyclase from a Vibrio species. Our results thus highlight a new sub-class within the class II
adenylyl cyclase family, defined as actin-activated nucleotidyl cyclase (AA-NC) toxins.

<a> Here, we describe the identification of actin as the cofactor that
activates P. aeruginosa ExoY and the ExoY-like module present in MARTX toxin of V.
nigripulchritudo in host cells

<na> Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients.
The nucleotidyl cyclase toxin ExoY is a virulence factors injected by the pathogen and
associated with severe damage to lung tissue.

<na> The physiological effects of ExoY resulting from accumulation of these cyclic nucleotides
include the hyperphosphorylation of tau and the disruption of microtubules causing the
formation of gaps between endothelial cells and increased permeability of the endothelial
barrier.

<na> Despite the progress in understanding downstream effects of ExoY activity,
fundamental information on ExoY is lacking: as other bacterial soluble related cyclases such
as CyaA and EF, ExoY is inactive in bacteria and is activated by an eukaryotic cofactor after
its delivery to the target cells.

<na> To test this hypothesis, we
prepared extracts from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 cells and measured adenylate
cyclase activity of recombinant ExoY carrying an N-terminal His-Flag tag (HF-ExoY) in the
presence of increasing amounts of yeast cell extract in vitro.

<na> We observed a dose dependent stimulation of ExoY activity by yeast cell
86 extract, to levels that were similar to those measured when using the extract from HeLa cells
87 (Fig. 1a).

<na> Since actin is one of the most
highly conserved and abundant proteins in eukaryotic cells, it appeared to be a potential
candidate for activating ExoY ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells.

<na> To verify the interaction between ExoY and mammalian actin in vitro, we performed Ni-
NTA agarose pulldowns. ExoY with a C-terminal Flag-His tag (ExoY-FH) and α-actin from
rabbit skeletal muscle (Cytoskeleton, Inc., designated here MA-99) were added at equimolar
concentrations to Ni-NTA agarose beads in batch.

<q> Which mutations cause FALS?

<a> In 1993, hSOD1 was
identified to be the first gene associated with ALS (15), and mutations in the SOD1 gene cause
the most prevalent form of ALS, accounting for ~20% of total ALS cases (14-16).

<a> Iron is currently known to
trigger oxidative stress by Fenton chemistry but no report implies that iron manifests its
toxicity through CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), the central antioxidant enzyme in all
human tissues that carries >180 ALS-causing mutations.

<a> Currently,
181 mutations have been identified within the 153-residue hSOD1 that are linked to ALS
(http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/) but their underlying mechanism for triggering ALS pathogenesis
remains elusive (16).

<na> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most prominent adult motor-neuron disease,
clinically characteristic of progressive motor-neuron loss in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor
cortex, which leads to paralysis and death within a few years of disease onset.

<na> Recently the failure or even reduced efficiency of the
maturation has been proposed as a common mechanism for trapping the ALS-causing mutants in
the highly-toxic species without the disulfide bridge, which are also prone to aggregation
(13,29,30).

<na> Both are expected to contribute to
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including ALS as well as aging. This may partly
rationalize the observation that under certain pathological conditions, the wild-type hSOD1 is
also able to acquire cellular toxicity to initiate ALS.

degeneration in ALS. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 27, 723–749 (2004).

<na> Kwan JY, et al. Iron accumulation in deep cortical layers accounts for MRI signal
abnormalities in ALS: Correlating 7 tesla MRI and pathology. PLoS ONE 7, e35241 (2012).

<na> The cell combats harmful ROS with multi-faceted anti-oxidant mechanisms, including
catalytic removal of reactive species by enzymes such as superoxide dismutases (SOD), which
removes superoxide radicals by catalyzing a dismutation reaction where one superoxide radical
is oxidized to form dioxygen and another is reduced to hydrogen peroxide (12-14).

<na> Previously, a Zn2+-bound structure of hSOD1 with super-stable mutations
(C6A/C11S) was determined by NMR (18), and Figure S1B presents (ΔCα–ΔCβ) chemical shifts
of this super-stable mutant (BMRB Entry 6821) and our folded hSOD1 of the native sequence.

<q> What is first-injection anomaly in isothermal titration calorimetry?

<a> Because the instrument can take a substantial (but variable)
period of time to stabilize at the desired experimental temperature
after loading the syringe, significant (> 0.1 µL) diffusive
loss can also contribute to a first injection shortfall. We therefore
programmed an initial 1 µL “throwaway injection” to avoid
the need to correct for diffusive titrant loss during the first 10
µL injection. The contribution from this initial 1 µL “throwaway”
injection was excluded from the fitting procedure during
analysis.

<na> Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) [1] is a popular technique
for probing phenomena of biological interest, including
protein-ligand interactions.

<na> Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can yield precise (±3%) estimates of the thermodynamic parameters describing biomolecular
association (affinity, enthalpy, and entropy), making it an indispensable tool for biochemistry and drug discovery.

<na> L. S. Mizoue, J. Tellinghuisen, The role of backlash in the “first injection
anomaly” in isothermal titration calorimetry, Anal. Biochem. 326 (2004)

<na> The same optimization study [9] demonstrated that the experimental
precision depended only weakly on the number of
injections m, recommending m = 10 for processes confidently
known to involve 1:1 complexation.

<na> Our
GE/MicroCal VP-ITC instrument has a syringe assembly that
utilizes a worm gear which, after the recommended purge-refill
process, will cause a titrant shortfall in the first injection unless
a “down syringe” command is issued prior to loading the syringe
into the sample cell.

<na> Here, the
blank heats were small and uniform, of the same magnitude as
water-into-water injections. The least-squares (LS) fit of the
thermodynamic parameters to the integrated injection heats are
shown in the caption of Figure 1.

<na> JDC and SEB acknowledge funding from the Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, as well as from the California
Institute for Quantitative Biosciences (QB3) at the University
of California during earlier stages of this work.

<na> The error reported by the LS fit only represents the error in
model fitting assuming the specified concentration for titrant
is exact—we must now include the uncertainty in the titrant
concentration to obtain an estimate of the true error.

<q> What is used to alighn G protein family of nucleotide-dependent switches?

<a> In this work, we use a PFAM-based alignment of the G protein family of nucleotide-dependent switches (PFAM,
PF00071, version 27.0). The alignment comprises 21133 sequences by 1599 positions, but after the pre-processing
steps with default values for thresholds, we obtain a final sequence alignment of 4978 sequences by 158 positions, with
an effective number of sequences upon weighting of 3364.

<na>Here, we present the principles and implementation of the SCA method for identifying
sectors and introduce new tools for understanding the global patterns of coevolution between amino acid positions.
The methods are implemented in a python-based software package that is available to the scientific community, and
illustrated in the main text using the small G protein family of nucleotide-dependent switches (27; 28) as a model
system (see supplementary section V.A for complete tutorial).

<na> Interestingly, mapping of the positions comprising sector 1 describes a physically contiguous group of amino
acid residues that shows excellent agreement with the nucleotide-dependent allosteric mechanism (47). The sector
is compact in the GTP-bound state but partially disrupted in the GDP-state, a finding consistent with the statedependent
connectivity between the nucleotide-binding pocket and the switch loops.

<na> Consistent
with assignment as an independent sector, sector 2 (red) also comprises a mostly physically contiguous group within
the core of the G protein; like IC3 of sector 1 (cyan) it shows no nucleotide-dependent conformational plasticity. The
physical role of sector 2 is unclear to our knowledge, but its definition represents a basis for further study. These
findings show that in contrast to the first-order analysis of positional conservation, the study of conserved coevolution
leads to new insights and hypotheses about protein function that are not merely a recapitulation of known structural
or functional features.

<na> This result
is particularly interesting since IC1 and IC2 undergo significant nucleotide-dependent conformational change, make
direct interactions with effector molecules, and are contiguous only in context of IC3. In contrast, IC3 and IC4
correspond to physically contiguous groups of amino acids that show no structural variation between the GTP- and
GDP-bound states.

<na> The essential biological properties of proteins - folding, biochemical activities, and the capacity to
adapt - arise from the global pattern of interactions between amino acid residues. The statistical
coupling analysis (SCA) is an approach to defining this pattern that involves the study of amino
acid coevolution in an ensemble of sequences comprising a protein family.

<na> We show that the pattern
of amino acid interactions within sectors is linked to the divergence of functional lineages in a
multiple sequence alignment - a model for how sector properties might be differentially tuned in
members of a protein family.

<na> While an alignment of a protein family is in principle sufficient for an analysis of coevolution, taxonomic
and functional annotations and atomic structures are valuable for interpretation. In this work, we will assume that
an atomic structure is known for at least one sequence in the alignment.

<na> The cooperativity of amino acids in specifying protein folding and function implies that the concept of positional
conservation of individual positions should at least be extended to a concept of pairwise conservation, reporting
coevolution between positions in a protein family.

<na> Figure 3A-B shows the C˜ij matrix for the G protein family. As previously reported, the matrix is heterogeneous,
with a small number of positions engaged in significantly higher correlations than most positions (Fig. 3A, (6; 10)).
Hierarchical clustering makes this heterogeneity more apparent (Fig. 3B).

<q> Has Naa10 any connection to bond formation?

<a> Furthermore, overexpression of Naa10 in transgenic mice resulted in
calvarial fontanels being less closed and bones being less dense, a lower osteoblast surface and
reduced mRNA of osteoblastic genes (delayed bone development), whereas Naa10 knockout
mice exhibit normal skeletal structure at day 3 after birth and bones developed to a greater extent,
supporting the idea that Naa10 functions in Runx2-mediated osteogenesis in vivo (Yoon et al.,
2014).

<na> Naa15 also has been implicated in osteogenesis. Studies of the osteocalcin promoter
identified Naa15, Ku70 and Ku80 as possible regulators. These proteins bind the osteocalcin
promoter and activate osteocalcin expression synergistically with Runx2, suggesting a functional
interactions between Ku, Naa15, and Runx2 (Willis et al., 2002).

<a> Phenotypic analyses from transgenic mice implicate Naa10 in bone development and link
Naa10 to the runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2). In the early phase of bone development,
Runx2 regulates osteoblast differentiation through transactivation of many genes including
collagen α1, osteopontin, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteocalcin (OCN).

<na> Roughly, about 40 % of all human proteins are substrates of Naa10 and the
impact of this modification has only been studied for a few of them. Besides acting as a NAT
in the NatA complex, recently other functions have been linked to Naa10, including posttranslational
NTA, lysine acetylation, and NAT/KAT-independent functions.

<na> As mentioned above, the NatA complex consists at least of the auxiliary and catalytic
subunit, Naa15 and Naa10, respectively and is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to vertebrates
(Mullen et al., 1989; Park and Szostak, 1992; Sugiura et al., 2003; Arnesen et al., 2005a). We
adopt here the nomenclature of inserting letters to indicate the species about which we are
discussing, so yNatA refers to NatA in yeast, where we are specifically referring to S. cerevesiae,
hNatA refers to NatA in humans, and mNatA refers to NatA in mice.

<na> Size-exclusion chromatography and circular dichroism showed that purified human
Naa10 consists of a compact globular region comprising two thirds of the protein and a flexible
unstructured C-terminus (Sánchez-Puig and Fersht, 2006).

<na> We discuss the possible interaction with NatE in more
detail below. Naa10 adopts a typical GNAT fold containing a N-terminal α1–loop–α2 segment
that features one large hydrophibic interface and exhibits the most intimate interactions with
Naa15, a central acetyl CoA-binding region and C-terminal segments that are similar to the
corresponding regions in Naa50 (Liszczak et al., 2013).

<na> Therefore, further studies have to show if Type I actins are unique substrates
of non-complexed Naa10 and/or if more in vivo substrates with acidic N-termini exist. Such
studies also need to explore whether the NTA of actin does trigger any downstream processing in
the Arg/N-end rule pathway.

<na> Thus it is not yet known how much lysine is directly acetylated by Naa10 in vivo, and
the degree to which autoacetylation of Naa10 occurs in vivo is also currently not well
characterized.

<na> In
contrast, Arnesen and colleagues did not find a decreased Naa10 protein level in hypoxia in
HT1080, RCC4, HeLa, MCF-7 and HEK293 cells, but could confirm the interaction of Naa10
with HIF-1α ODD suggesting a putative, still unclear, connection between these proteins
(Arnesen et al., 2005b).

<q> How 3xFNLDD-D could be expressed?

<a> This protein was confirmed as 3xFNLDD-D by immunoblot analysis with anti-Dock Ab (Figure
2B). Thus, 3xFNLDD-D could be expressed in a silkworm pupa and purified without visible
degradation.

<a> For preparation of the purified r3xFNLDD-D, we utilized a silkworm-baculovirus
expression system [9]. In this system, 3xFNLDD-D was expressed in a silkworm pupa by
infection of baculoviruses expressing 3xFNLDD-D.

<a> In this system, recombinant 3xFNLDD-D (r3xFNLDD-D) consisting of the
3xFLAG-tag, a nuclear localization signal, the DNA-binding domain plus the dimerization
domain of the LexA protein, and the Dock-tag is used for isolation of specific genomic regions.
3xFNLDD-D was expressed using a silkworm-baculovirus expression system and purified by
affinity purification.

<na> The iChIP system using r3xFNLDD-D can isolate specific genomic regions
retaining molecular interactions without expression of the exogenous DNA-binding protein in the
cell to be analyzed.

<na> In addition, we could detect RNA associated with the cPax5
locus using this form of the iChIP system combined with RT-PCR. Thus, iChIP using
r3xFNLDD-D would be more straightforward and useful to isolate specific genomic regions for
their biochemical analysis.

<na> Next, we examined whether the purified r3xFNLDD-D could be utilized for isolation of
genomic regions of interest from vertebrate cells. To this end, we used the chicken
DT40-devivative cell line, DT40#205-2, in which 8 x repeats of LexA BE were inserted 0.3 kbp
upstream of the exon 1A of the single-copy endogenous cPax5 gene [10] (Figure 3A).

<na> These results suggested that
r3xFNLDD-D can bind to LexA BE even in the crosslinked chromatin and iChIP using
r3xFNLDD-D is able to specifically purify target genomic regions.

<na> Next, we examined whether iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D could be utilized to isolate and
identify molecules interacting with genomic regions of interest in cells. To this end, we attempted
to isolate the cPax5 locus including the exon 1A region by iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D and detect
the nascent RNA transcribed from the TSS of the cPax5 exon 1A by RT-PCR (Figure 5A).

<na> As shown in Figure 5B, iChIP using r3xFNLDD-D isolated the
cPax5 exon 1A region but not the exon 3 region of the irrelevant cAID gene, which encodes an
enzyme essential for B cell-specific immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation and class switch

<na> The exogenous DNA-binding protein fused with a tag(s) is expressed in the cell and the
target genomic region is purified with antibody against the tag(s). In this study, we developed the
iChIP system using recombinant DNA-binding proteins to make iChIP more straightforward.

<q> What carbon source for autotrophs?

<a> The formal oxidation state of a carbon atom in an organic molecule can be calculated by counting -1 for
each carbon-hydrogen bond, 0 for each carbon-carbon bond, and -1 for each bond of carbon to O, N or
S [8, 15]. In photosynthesizing organisms, and autotrophs in general, the carbon source is CO2, having
the highest oxidation state of carbon (+4).

<na> The degree of oxidation of carbon atoms in organic molecules depends on the covalent structure.
In proteins, the average oxidation state of carbon (ZC) can be calculated as an elemental ratio from
the chemical formula.

<na> To investigate oxidation-reduction (redox) patterns, groups of proteins from
different subcellular locations and phylogenetic divisions were selected for comparison. Extracellular
proteins of yeast have a relatively high oxidation state of carbon, corresponding with oxidizing
conditions outside of the cell.

<na> Throughout this study, “reducing” and “oxidizing” are used in reference to oxidation-reduction potential,
tied to a particular redox couple or to environmental conditions, often expressed as millivolts on the Eh
scale. “Reduced” and “oxidized” are used to refer to variations in the oxidation state of carbon.

<na> Even if the molecular structure is unknown,
analytical elemental compositions can be used in calculations of the average oxidation state of carbon in
biomass [16, 17]. Because any gene or protein sequence corresponds to a definite canonical (nonionized,
unphosphorylated) chemical formula, the average oxidation state of carbon in these biomolecules is
easily calculated.

<na> If two thiol groups react
to form a disulfide bond, the oxidation states of the two affected sulfur atoms change from -2 to -1.
Although H2 is produced in this reaction, the oxidation state of carbon in the protein remains constant.
It follows that equation (1) is applicable only to chemical formulas of proteins in which the N, O, and S
are all fully reduced (bonded only to H and/or C).

<na> Average oxidation state of carbon shown in histograms and normal probability plots for (a-b)
all human proteins and (c-d) human membrane proteins. Only proteins of sequence length greater than
or equal to 50 amino acids are considered.

<na> A schematic drawing of a yeast cell showing median values of the average oxidation state of
carbon in proteins from selected subcellular locations listed in table 1. All cellular components listed
in the table are represented in the drawing.

<na> Note that this scheme refers to the relative oxidation states
of carbon of the proteins, not the oxidation of protein thiol groups to form disulfides. Disulfide bond
formation takes place during folding and secretion of proteins, and may also contribute to glutathione
metabolism [4].

<na> We now turn to a comparison of homologues of a specific protein. Rubisco is an essential enzyme
for carbon fixation. Sequence comparison of homologues (related sequences that appear in different
organisms) has provided the basis for many phylogenetic studies [53].

<q> How many mutations cancer patients do carry in protein coding regions?

<a> However, cancer patients
usually carry an average of 33 to 66 mutations in the protein coding regions and those mutations are supposed
to take unequal roles in oncogenesis [5, 6]. It remains a great challenge to distinguish the functional mutations
that give cells with growth advantages [7], from the ones with non-crucial roles to oncogenesis.

<na> The progress of cancer genome sequencing projects yields unprecedented information of mutations
for numerous patients. However, the complexity of mutation profiles of patients hinders the further
understanding of mechanisms of oncogenesis. One basic question is how to uncover mutations with
functional impacts.

<na> With this method, the functional mutations are determined by checking the mutation
enrichment among a group of patients with similar expression profiles. We applied this method to three
cancer types and identified the functional mutations.

<na> To improve the accuracy, most computational tools also consider
background mutation rates and protein sizes in discovery of recurrent mutations [10, 11, 12]. Another
strategy is mutual exclusivity, which is based on an assumption that if one gene is mutated in a patient, other
members acting in the same signalling pathway are less likely to be mutated [13].

<na> Somatic mutations in coding regions are usually supposed to involve oncogenesis by affecting the activities
of proteins associated with cell proliferation [20]. However, somatic mutations at different sites have different
effects on protein activities. One solution is to study the stability of protein structures after mutations.
Amino acid changes in the protein sequences can either stabilize, destabilize or have no effect on protein
structures.

<na> This method
is based on two assumptions: (1) functional mutations will lead to altered expression of genes which reflects
consequences of somatic gene mutations; (2) patients with similar expression profiles are more likely to
carry functional mutations to the same genes.

<na> Similar
to TP53, we observed that the patients with functional MAP3K1 mutations were less likely to carry the
mutations to other components of MAPKKK cascade pathways (p < 0.01).

<na> The significance of ratio differences
was at p < 0.018. This observation suggests that patients with functional TP53 mutation are less likely to
carry PIK3CA mutations.

<na> Methods based on this strategy calculate the protein folding free energy, which will be used
to evaluate the protein structural stability [21, 22, 23]. However, those methods still face the problems of
establishing the direct connections between protein structures and activities.

<na> TTN protein is a component of vertebrate
striated muscle [28]. By searching literature, we did not find any reports to support TTN to take critical
role in cancer. By checking its protein sequence, we found that it is very long with a length of 27,000 to
33,000 amino acids [29], indicating a recurrence bias of its mutations.

<q> What is environmental specificity of a microbial species?

<a> The second type of quantitative trait is the environmental specificity of a microbial species, which we
define as the conditional probability that a sample is derived from a specific environment versus others, given
that the species is present in the sample.

<na> To apply this method
across the bacterial tree of life, where most species have not been experimentally phenotyped, we used
metagenomes from hundreds of people to quantify each species' prevalence in and specificity for the gut
microbiome.

<na> The
prevalence and specificity of bacterial species in an environment, such as the human gut, are quantitative
traits that we hypothesized could be estimated directly from shotgun metagenomics data. The precise
taxonomic composition of a healthy gut microbiome can vary significantly from person to person, indicating
that the ability of a microbe to colonize the gut is quantitative (and likely context-dependent, and stochastic).

<na> We estimate this parameter
with a body-site specificity score that uses metagenomics data to measure how predictive a particular microbe
is for the gut versus other body sites (e.g., skin, urogenital tract, oropharynx, or lung).

<a> The second type of environmental specificity we considered is the conditional probability that a host
has a disease given that a particular species is present. This disease-specific specificity score is estimated
in a similar way to the body-site specificity score (see Methods).

<na> Determining agreement with this
screen is somewhat complicated by the fact that we associated gene presence to gut specificity across all
members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and not only within the Bacteroides genus.

<na> In summary, using phylogenetic linear models, we were able to discover thousands of specific gene families
associated with quantitative phenotypes calculated directly from data: overall gut prevalence, a specificity
score for the gut over other body sites, and a specificity score for the gut in Crohn's disease versus health.

<na> The mechanisms by which different microbes colonize the healthy human gut versus free-living communities,
other body sites, or the gut in disease states remain largely unknown. Identifying microbial
genes influencing fitness in the gut could lead to new ways to engineer probiotics or disrupt pathogenesis.

<na> In particular, creating new therapies, whether those are drugs, engineered bacterial strains, or rationally
designed communities, will likely require an understanding of gut colonization at the level of individual
microbial genes.

<na> We take a complementary approach and use a flexible technique, known as phylogenetic linear modeling,
to detect associations between microbial genotype and phenotype while accounting for the fact that microbes
are related to one another by vertical descent.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/189787

<q> What is the percentage of disease-associated proteins for a disease, which
directly interact with each other?

<a> For example, recent studies found that only a relatively small fraction of
disease-associated proteins physically interact with each other, suggesting that methods, which predict
disease proteins by searching for dense clusters/communities of interacting proteins in the network, may
be limited in discovering disease pathways.

<na> They start with a few known disease-associated proteins and aim to find the
rest of the pathway by exploring the PPI network around the known disease proteins. However, the success
of such methods has been limited, and failure cases have not been well understood.

<na> Proteins associated with a disease are projected onto
the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. In this work, disease pathway denotes a subgraph of the PPI network
defined by the set of disease-associated proteins.

<a> Through spatial analysis of the PPI network
we find that proximity of disease-associated proteins within the PPI network is statistically insignificant
for 92% (476 of 519) diseases, and that 90% of diseases are associated with proteins that tend not to
significantly interact with each other, indicating that disease proteins are weakly embedded—rather than
densely interconnected—in the PPI network.

<na> Computational discovery of a disease pathway aims to identify proteins and other molecules associated
with the disease. Discovered pathways are systems of interacting proteins and molecules that, when
mutated or otherwise altered in the cell, manifest themselves as distinct disease phenotypes (Figure 1A).

<na> As understanding each disease protein in isolation cannot fully explain most human diseases, numerous
computational methods were developed to predict which proteins are associated with a given disease,
and to bring them together into pathways using the PPI network (Figure 1B).

<na> We then consider state-of-the-art network-based methods for disease protein discovery (Figure 1B).
These methods use the PPI network and a small set of known disease proteins to predict new proteins
that are likely associated with a given disease. However, as we show here, current methods disregard
loosely connected proteins when making predictions, causing many disease pathway components in the
PPI network to remain unnoticed.

<na> We demonstrate that taking these higher-order
network structures into account can shrink the gap between current and goal performance of disease
protein discovery methods.

<na> . In direct neighborhood scoring, each protein
is assigned a score that is proportional to the percentage of its neighbors associated with the disease. To
identify clusters that extend beyond direct neighbors, the methods start with a small set of disease proteins
(seed proteins) and grow a cluster by expanding the seeds with the highest scoring proteins.

<na> We here
consider a neural embedding-based approach that first learns a 128-dimensional vector representation
for each protein using a single-layer neural network and random walks and then fits a logistic regression
classifier that predicts candidate disease proteins based on these feature vectors.

*<q> How we define SNP address?

<na> We also introduce
the ‘SNP address’ nomenclature to describe the relationship between isolates in a population to
the single nucleotide resolution.

<na> In this application note we present SnapperDB, a set
of tools to store bacterial variant data to facilitate reproducible and scalable
analysis of bacterial populations. We introduce the ‘SNP address’
nomenclature to describe the relationship between isolates in a population
to the nucleotide resolution.

<na> The resultant ‘SNP address’ provides an
isolate level nomenclature where two isolates with the same SNP addresses
have 0 SNP differences. The SNP address has become the primary
whole genome sequencing result for the surveillance of food-borne
pathogens in the England and has been utilised as the case definition in
international outbreak investigations.

<na> The SNP address is the first strain level nomenclature, to our knowledge,
developed for WGS pathogen surveillance and provides a framework for
cluster identification, definition and investigation.

<a> As new strains are added to SnapperDB they are compared to the database
and a distance matrix is maintained of pairwise SNP distances.
Furthermore, this matrix is available for clustering. Single linkage clustering
of genetic distance is an effective method of describing phylogenetic
groups as it is inclusive of clonal expansion events. Using hierarchical
single linkage clustering of pairwise SNP distances we can derive
an isolate level nomenclature for each genome sequence allowing efficient
searching of the population studied as well as facilitating automated,
real-time cluster detection. Single linkage clustering is performed
at seven descending thresholds of SNP distance; 250, 100, 50,
25, 10 and 0 SNPs. This clustering results in a discrete seven-digit code
where each number represents the cluster membership at each descending
SNP distance threshold. The resultant ‘SNP address’ provides an
isolate level nomenclature where two isolates with the same SNP addresses
have 0 SNP differences.

<na> As new strains are added to SnapperDB they are compared to the database
and a distance matrix is maintained of pairwise SNP distances.
Furthermore, this matrix is available for clustering.

<na> Real-time surveillance of infectious disease using WGS data poses challenges
in both result generation and communication. In this article, we
introduce SnapperDB an end-to-end solution for processing of FASTQ
reads to high quality variants that can be stored in a queryable database.

<na> For each strain, SnapperDB stores the variant positions and the ignored
positions in a PostgreSQL database, with positions the same as the reference
genome not stored.

<na> Options to output
whole genome alignments, or alignments that employ partial or complete
deletion of missing positions are available. SnapperDB is compatible
with the GFF output from recombination detection software such as
Gubbins to mask positions from alignments as required.

<q> What is the input for Selenzyme?

<a> A Selenzyme query consists of a target reaction, represented in .rxn format
(MDL) or a character string using either the SMARTS format or the derivative
SMIRKS representation for generalized reactions (Daylight Theory Manual,
Version 4.9. http://www.daylight.com/ (accessed 1 September 2017)).

<na> Here, we present Selenzyme, a free online enzyme
selection tool for metabolic pathway design. The user is guided through
several decision steps in order to shortlist the best candidates for a given
pathway step.

<na> Selenzyme provides
bespoke sequence selection for automated workflows in biofoundries. The
tool is integrated as part of the pathway design stage into the design-build-
test-learn SYNBIOCHEM pipeline.

<na> Here, we
extend such capabilities through Selenzyme, a sequence selection with the
ability to mine generalized reaction rules that is integrated into a larger
computational design pipeline for metabolic engineering within the
SYNBIOCHEM Centre that includes the RetroPath 2.0 workflow (Delepine et
al., 2017) and will be integrated with the downstream tool PartsGenie
(Swainston, Dunstan, et al., 2017).

<na> A unique feature of Selenzyme is
that target reactions do not necessarily need to exist in databases, enabling
the tool to search for alternative routes for biosynthesis, degradation and
transport either for natural or non-natural products.

<na> Selenzyme uses SYNBIOCHEM’s biochem4j graph database (Swainston,
Batista-Navarro, et al., 2017) (June 2017) as its main data source. The
database contains relevant information on known relationships between
reactions (36765), chemicals (19735), enzymes (245704) and organisms
(8431).

<na> Selenzyme is a flexible tool that can provide enzyme selection solutions in
different scenarios. One typical application case is in the selection of enzyme
sequences to engineer a biosynthetic pathway. We consider for instance the
biosynthetic pathway of the flavonoid pinocembrin engineered in the chassis
organism Escherichia coli.

<na> On top of this core tool, there is a web server built using Flask in Python that
provides a web interface where the user can input the reaction query as an
.rxn file or a SMARTS string.

<na> The output generates a .csv file
containing the list of top sequence candidates initially ranked based on
reaction similarity followed by conservation score (if the MSA is available) and
phylogenetic distance, along with associated properties and references, as
well as a fasta file with the Uniprot sequences.

<na> The algorithm proceeds through the list of reactions ranked by decreasing
similarity and collects annotated sequences associated with the reactions
down to the desired number of targets, which is a user-configurable
parameter.

<q> What sort of phenotypic data is normally available in bacterial population studies?

<a> PlasmidTron utilises the phenotypic data normally available in bacterial population studies, such as
antibiograms, virulence factors, or geographic information, to identify sequences that are likely to
represent MGEs linked to the phenotype.

<na> We can utilise the wealth of phenotypic data usually generated for bacterial population studies, be it
routine diagnostics, surveillance or outbreak investigation, to reconstruct plasmids responsible for a
particular phenotype.

<na> When comparing these bacterial populations, it is apparent that some of
these phenotypes do not follow the phylogeny of the host i.e. they are genetically unlinked to the
evolutionary history of the host bacterium. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that
the genes are moving independently between hosts and are likely associated with mobile genetic
elements (MGE).

<na> We present
the results of a real outbreak of S. Typhi where PlasmidTron was used to identify the plasmid
sequence carrying a novel AMR resistance profile, not previously described in S. Typhi H58/4.3.1,
and validated the results using long read sequencing. Whilst plasmid assembly remains difficult with
short reads, PlasmidTron allows for phenotypic data to be utilised to greatly reduce the complexity
of the challenge.

<na> Makendi C, Page AJ, Wren BW, Le Thi Phuong T, Clare S, Hale C, et al. A Phylogenetic and
Phenotypic Analysis of Salmonella enterica Serovar Weltevreden, an Emerging Agent of
Diarrheal Disease in Tropical Regions. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2016 Feb;10(2):e0004446.

<na> However, identifying the element that is associated with these traits can be
complex if the starting point is short read WGS data. With the increased use of next generation WGS
in routine diagnostics, surveillance and epidemiology a vast amount of short read data is available
and these types of associations are relatively unexplored.

<na> One way to address this would be to
perform assembly de novo of the whole genome read data, including its MGEs. However, MGEs are
often full of repeats and can lead to fragmented consensus sequences. Deciding which sequence is
part of the chromosome, and which is part of a MGE can be ambiguous.

<na> A number of recent methods have been developed to address the problem of assembling some of
these MGEs, from NGS data (1). plasmidSPAdes (2) detects plasmids by analysing the coverage of
assembled contigs to separate out chromosomes from plasmid like sequences.

<na> Unicycler (3) is a hybrid
assembler which can combine short and long read data to produce fully circularised chromosomes
and plasmids.

<na> To evaluate the effectiveness of PlasmidTron three datasets were used including: 1) simulated reads
to show the impact of copy number variation in identifying plasmids, 2) the effectiveness of different
methods in recalling plasmid type sequences on real world data, and 3) identification of a novel AMR
plasmid with subsequent validation using long read sequencing.

<q> How many human samples does ARCHS4 contain?

<a> In total
137,792 samples are accessible through ARCHS4 with 72,363
mouse and 65,429 human samples. Through efficient use of
cloud resources and dockerized deployment of the sequencing
pipeline, the alignment cost per sample is reduced to less than
one cent. ARCHS4 is updated automatically by adding newly
published samples to the database as they become available.

<na> ficant barrier for global and integrative retrospective
analyses. To address this challenge, we developed all RNA-seq
and ChIP-seq sample and signature search (ARCHS4), a web
resource that makes the majority of previously published
RNA-seq data from human and mouse freely available at
the gene count level.

<na> Additionally, the ARCHS4 web interface provides intuitive
exploration of the processed data through querying tools,
interactive visualization, and gene landing pages that provide
average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed
genes, and predicted biological functions and protein-protein
interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined
with co-expression.

<na> ARCHS4 provides multiple channels of processed RNA-seq
data from GEO/SRA to support retrospective data analyses
and reuse. ARCHS4 caters to users with different levels of
computational expertise and can be employed for many posthoc
analyses and projects.

<na> The usefulness of the resource
is exemplified through case studies that show how the data
assembled for ARCHS4 can be used to predict gene function
and protein-protein interactions.

<na> Unprocessed SRA files
are entered as jobs into the scheduler database of ARCHS4.
The job scheduler is a dockerized web application with APIs
to communicate job instructions to worker instances, and for
saving the final gene count files.

<na> For ARCHS4, we ran 400 Docker instances of Kallisto
in parallel due to AWS cap of 200 EC2 instances. The autoscaling
group is set to launch 200 m4.large general compute
instances with 2 vCPUs and 8GB of memory and 200GB
of SSD disk storage.

<na> It then requests the matching GSE series
matrices from ARCHS4 containing the gene expression
counts and metadata information for the GSE. Additionally,
the ARCHS4 Chrome extension requests JSON objects with
pre-computed clustered gene expression for visualizing the
samples with Clustergrammer.

<na> To address this challenge, we developed all RNA-seq
and ChIP-seq sample and signature search (ARCHS4), a web
resource that makes the majority of previously published
RNA-seq data from human and mouse freely available at
the gene count level.

<na> The completion of the human genome project (1) enabled
the quantification of mRNA expression at the genomewide
scale, initially with cDNA microarray technology (2).

<q> How to improve an alignment of genome?

<a> Alignment is improved by realigning genomes at sites
where a gap ends in one sequence and starts in the
other (referred to as ”consecutive gaps”). We scan
through the whole alignment and identify all positions
with consecutive gaps.

<na> . The second index file contains
the coordinates of all gaps of all sequences per
block in the consensus genome, improving the performance
of the reconstruction step and the mapping of
coordinates between genomes.

<na> We introduce seq-seq-pan, a framework that provides methods for adding or removing new genomes
from a set of aligned genomes and uses these to construct a whole genome alignment.

<na> Another (well-established) representation of sets of
genomes is their alignment. Whole genome alignments
(WGA) implicitly provide a coordinate system that
allows the translation between pan-genome and strain
genome position, enabling annotation of the alignment
with biological features of the individual genomes.

<na> In summary, WGA
structures presently fulfill most of the desirable properties
of a pan-genome, but a severe drawback of existing
methods is their final, non-updatable alignment
result.

<na> Throughout the sequential process
we take measures to optimize the resulting whole
genome alignment and provide a linear representation
that can be used with established methods for subsequent
analyses such as read mapping and variant
detection.

<na> The key notion of seq-seq-pan is to use and optimize
fast, well established whole genome alignment
methods to construct a pan-genome from an a priori
indefinite set of genomes.

<na> The complete alignment of
all genomes is reconstructed from the current and prevenient
alignment (Fig. 1). Optimizing measures are
taken throughout the workflow to maintain the synteny
of the original genomes and avoid accumulation
of short, unrelated sequence blocks.

<na> One contains the start positions
of all delimiter sequences within the consensus genome
and therefore enables the reconstruction of the alignment
of all genomes from the alignment of the consensus
genome with an additional sequence (referred to
as ”consensus index file”).

<na> After removing a genome from a pan-genome, gaps
that were introduced only for the alignment of the removed
genome are cut from the remaining genomes.

<q> What can remove remove replication links in Escherichia coli DNA?

<a> In E. coli DNA replication yields interlinked chromosomes. Controlling topological changes
associated with replication and returning the newly replicated chromosomes to an unlinked monomeric
state is essential to cell survival. In the absence of the topoisomerase topoIV, the site-specific recom-
bination complex XerCD-dif-FtsK can remove replication links by local reconnection.

<na> In the absence of the topoisomerase topoIV, the site-specific recom-
bination complex XerCD-dif-FtsK can remove replication links by local reconnection.

<na> We conclude that the minimal pathway of unlinking replication links that was found un-
der more stringent assumptions is the most probable. We also present exact results on unlinking a
6-crossing replication link.

<na> The proposed unlinking pathway, through which the enzymes unlink the replication links in a
step-wise fashion is illustrated in Fig. 1A. In the figure, each closed curve represents a circular dsDNA
molecule. The components of a two-component link represent two newly replicated DNA chains.

<na> Using this method we embark
on a numerical study relevant to unlinking of DNA replication links by site-specific recombination a
dif sites.

<na> In the case of unlinking of DNA replication links, each component of the link corresponds to a newly
replicated chromosome from E.coli with one dif site in each component. This example motivated our
choice to let two reconnection sites within a single circle be equidistant, and the two components of
a linked product or substrate have the same length.

<a> Nicking of a single DNA strand, however extensive, is insufficient
to unlink two newly replicated DNA circles unless pre-existing nicks are present along the second
strand. The type II topoisomerase topoIV is a major decatenase in E. coli. Grainge et al. showed
that in the absence of topoIV, the XerCD-dif-FtsK molecular machine can act in vivo to separate
two interlinked, newly replicated chromosomes.

<na> Flexible circular chains appear often in nature, from microscopic DNA plasmids to macroscopic loops
in solar corona. Such chains entrap rich geometrical and topological complexity which can give insight
into the processes underlying their formation or modification.

<na> The action of recombination enzymes is a local reconnection event. We
here investigate pathways of unlinking of newly replicated DNA links by local reconnection. The results
presented, and the numerical methods proposed are not restricted to the biological example and are
applicable to any local reconnection process.

<na> The results in Shimokawa et al.7 provide unprecedented detail
in the study of the topological mechanism of DNA unlinking by site-specific recombination. Going
beyond the original problem of unlinking newly replicated circular chromosomes, these results apply
to any reconnection event that can be modeled using tangles as in Fig. 1.

<q> What are genomic islands?

<a> Genomic islands (GI) are clusters of genes that have entered a genome via horizontal
gene transfer, that is, outside the normal process of parent-offspring inheritance.

<na> Genomic islands play an important role in microbial genome evolution,
providing a mechanism for strains to adapt to new ecological conditions. A
variety of computational methods, both genome-composition based and
comparative have been developed to identify them.

<na> Even multiple strain approaches are best suited
to identifying genomic islands that are present in one strain but absent in others.
They do not automatically recognize islands which are shared between some
strains in the clade or determine the branch on which these islands inserted
within the phylogenetic tree.

<na> In addition we use output from simulations and a set of known
genomic islands from the literature to show that xenoGI can accurately identify
genomic islands and place them on a phylogenetic tree.

<na> It identifies genomic islands, and determines which branch
they inserted on within the phylogenetic tree for the clade. Such information is
valuable because it helps us understand the adaptive path that has produced
living species.

<na> IslandPick is provided with a single input
genome where the user desires to find genomic islands. It first identifies a set of comparison
genomes, then creates pairwise whole genome alignments using MAUVE,
and finally analyzes the alignments to identify regions that are unique in the input
genome.

<na> But they do not
automatically identify genomic islands which are shared between some strains in
the clade, and they do not determine the branch on which those islands inserted
within the phylogenetic tree.

<na> We assessed the effectiveness of xenoGI in two ways: using simulations, and detecting
known genomic islands.

<na> However we cannot be sure that these
represent exhaustive lists of all genomic islands in a strain. For this reason, it does
not make sense to calculate a true positive rate or positive predictive value here.

<na> We look at two examples of genomic islands from the enteric bacteria with the goal
of demonstrating the sort of analysis one can do with xenoGI. We do this on a tree
of eleven enteric species.

<q> When we may observe PtK1 cells moving together attached?

<a> During their wound healing process, the PtK1 cells tend to attach together and move as a group.
As a result, images taken of PtK1 cells can contain cell boundaries of multiple cells, which may
make image analysis difficult.

<na> We were able to detect cryptic lamellipodial
edges of submarginal cells with high accuracy from the fluorescence time-lapse movies of PtK1
cells using both simple convolutional neural networks and VGG-16 based neural networks.

<na> Fluorescence images of PtK1 cells (kidney epithelial cells from a rat kangaroo) stained with
CellMask Orange (Invitrogen) were taken using a spinning disk confocal microscope (Fig. 1A).

<na> High contrast images of leading
edges of marginal PtK1 cells in wound healing responses can be obtained (Fig. 1A). However, the
leading edges of submarginal cells, which is driven by cryptic lamellipodia, are overlapping with
other neighboring cells, which generate the non-uniform background.

<na> Cell protrusion plays important roles in cell migration by pushing plasma membrane forward.
Cryptic lamellipodia induce the protrusion of submarginal cells in collective cell migration where
cells are attached and move together.

<na> By focusing on these edge candidates, we can substantially reduce the computational
cost. The Canny algorithm begins by using Gaussian smoothing to remove noise in the image. The
edge filters, which calculate the image gradient are used to determine the possible location of edges.
Then, non-maximum suppression is used to make the edges thinner.

biology 296, 137-149, doi:10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.04.451 (2006).

<na> Due to the noisy features within
overlapping cells, the conventional image analysis algorithms such as Canny edge detector and
intensity thresholding are limited. In this paper we combined Canny edge detector, Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), and local intensity thresholding.

<na> However, understanding single cell migration
is not sufficient enough to understand collective migration since cells are connected and they
communicate with each other. One important characteristic of epithelial sheet migration is the
coordination of movement between neighboring cells.

<na> Although conventional segmentation method is efficient in identifying outside borders of
cells, it is difficult to successfully identify cell edges when they overlap with each other during
collective cell migration.

<q> Where to find data on all transcribed enhancers (TrEn)?

<a> We used TELS to compile a
comprehensive catalog of motif signatures for all known TrEn identified by the FANTOM5 consortium
across 112 human primary cells and tissues. Our results confirm that distinct cell type/tissue specific
motif signatures characterize TrEn.

<na> In mammalian cells, transcribed enhancers (TrEn) play important roles in the initiation of gene
expression and maintenance of gene expression levels in spatiotemporal manner. One of the most
challenging questions in biology today is how the genomic characteristics of enhancers relate to
enhancer activities.

<na> These signatures allow discriminating successfully a) TrEn from
random controls, proxy of non-enhancer activity, and b) cell type/tissue specific TrEn from enhancers
expressed and transcribed in different cell types/tissues.

<na> With all of the above issues in mind, we introduce TELS (Transcribed Enhancer Landscape
Search) a novel bioinformatics algorithm that applies logistic regression (LR) coupled with
dimensionality reduction techniques to identify systematically the most informative combinations of
short sequence motifs of TrEn in the human genome.

<na> As importantly, TELS addresses the problem of
discriminating TrEn from different negative controls using exclusively DNA sequence characteristics
and without prior knowledge of Transcription Factor Binding sites (TFBSs) from ChIP-seq or Position
Weight Matrices (PWMs).

<na> Our analysis identified DNA signatures that are predictive of cell
type/tissue specific TrEn. The identified combinations of motifs discriminate successfully TrEn from
random controls, proxy of non-enhancer activity, as well as enhancers transcribed exclusively in cell
type/tissue specific manner from enhancers transcribed exclusively in different primary cells or
tissues.

<na> We used TELS to compile a comprehensive catalog of motif signatures that discriminate effectively
TrEn in 112 cell types/tissues included in the ‘all facets’ dataset from ‘all facets random controls’ (see
Materials and Methods for data description).

<na> These observations suggest that TrEn display cell type/tissue specific motif signatures that
are identified by TELS. Overall, the results presented in this subsection support the hypothesis that
specific genomic characteristics enable TrEn to operate in a highly cell type/tissue specific manner
and for this reason the identified motifs vary across different cell types/tissues.

<na> Next, we compare the results obtained using the ‘robust set’ of TrEn with the results
achieved in the previous subsection by analysing the ‘all facets’ dataset. In particular, by aggregating
the motif signatures per cell type/tissue from the ‘all facets’ dataset we observe that specific motifs
are selected with high frequency across 112 cell types/tissues.

<a> The primary datasets included in our study derive from the FANTOM5
Atlas of TrEn5. Using a large number of primary cells and tissues, that study identified bi-directional TrEn via CAGE experiments.
All enhancer samples were obtained from the Atlas webpage (http://enhancer.binf.ku.dk/presets/)
on November 2016.

<q> What is the limitation of t-SNE in case of using it for mass cytometry?

<a> In particular, dimensionality reduction-based
techniques like t-SNE offer single-cell resolution but are limited in the number of cells that can
be analysed.

<na> Thus, HSNE removes the
scalability limit of conventional t-SNE analysis, a feature that makes it highly suitable for the
analysis of massive high-dimensional datasets.

<a> Dimensionality reduction-based techniques, such as PCA,
t-SNE (implemented in viSNE), and Diffusion maps, do allow analysis at the single-cell level.
However, the linear nature of PCA renders it unsuitable to dissect the non-linear relationships in
mass cytometry data, while the non-linear methods (t-SNE and Diffusion maps) do retain local data structure,
but are limited by the number of cells that can be analyzed.

<na> Due to t-SNE limitations the dataset had to be downsampled by 57.7% (Fig. 2a) where it was
decided to equal the number of cells from blood and intestinal samples for a balanced
comparison, which led to the exclusion of more cells from the blood samples.

<na> . Moreover,
ACCENSE clustered only 50% of the t-SNE-embedded data into subsets (Fig. 2a). Together this
excluded 78.8% of the cells from the analysis. The remaining 1.1 million cells were annotated
into 142 phenotypically distinct immune subsets.

<na> There is an ongoing scientific debate on the validity of clustering in t-SNE maps versus direct
clustering on the high-dimensional space. However, it has been shown that stochastic neighbor
embedding (SNE) preserves and separates clusters in the high dimensional space.

<na> van der Maaten LJP and Hinton, G. E. Visualizing High-Dimensional Data Using t-SNE. J.
Mach. Learn. Res. 2579–2605 (2008).

<na> . A dataset consisting of 1 million cells
created by randomly sampling the 5.2 million cell dataset presented in the main text and three smaller
ones derived from this were analysed with HSNE and t-SNE resulting in highly similar embeddings.

<na> Although feasible with a strong computational infrastructure, t-SNE suffers from several problems
when analyzing datasets exceeding hundreds of thousands of cells.

<na> Intuitively, t-SNE accounts for small neighborhoods. By increasing the size of the input
data local neighborhoods will often become less strongly connected and can tear, resulting in the
displacement of cells in the plot. These effects might be reduced by increasing the perplexity value.

<q> What are the methods to predict peptide binding to MHC?

<na> Peptide binding to MHC molecules is the single
most selective step in the antigen presentation pathway. On the quest for T cell epitopes, the
prediction of peptide binding to MHC molecules has therefore attracted large attention.
In the past, predictors of peptide-MHC interaction have in most cases been trained on binding
affinity data.

<a> Recently an increasing amount of MHC presented peptides identified by mass
spectrometry has been published containing information about peptide processing steps in the
presentation pathway and the length distribution of naturally presented peptides. Here, we
present NetMHCpan-4.0, a method trained on both binding affinity and eluted ligand data
leveraging the information from both data types.

<na> In cases such peptides are
recognized, an immune response can be initiated potentially leading to killing of the infected
(mal-functioning) cell. The most selective step in the pathway leading to this peptide
presentation is the binding to MHC.

<a> Some of the most well documented and applied of methods for predicting peptide binding to
MHC class I include NetMHC (4,7), and NetMHCpan (1,8). These tools have over the last years
gained increasing interest due to the recent focus on neoantigen identification within the field of
personalized immunotherapy (9,10).

<na> As stated above this binding to MHC is the most selective
step in peptide antigen presentation. However, other factors including antigen processing (12)
and the stability of the peptide:MHC complex (13) could influence the likelihood of a given
peptide to be presented as an MHC ligand.

<na> As such, MS peptidome data would contain the comprehensive signal of
antigen processing and presentation rather than just MHC binding affinity. Moreover, MS
peptidome data generated by immunopeptidomic studies would contain precise information
about the allele-specific peptide length profile preferences not available in the MHC binding
affinity data sets.

<na> In this context, large efforts have over the last decades
been dedicated to experimentally characterize the peptide binding space of MHC molecules
using semi high-throughput MHC-peptide binding affinity assays (19,20), enabling binding
specificity characterization of a large set of MHC molecules from different species.

<na> The IEDB contains a comprehensive set of MHC binding and ligand data available in the public
domain. While this data set contains binding affinity data characterizing more than 150 different
MHC class I molecules (from human, non-human primates, mouse, and life-stock), at the onset
of this study only 55 MHC class I molecules were characterized by MS peptidome data.

<na> While recent works have demonstrated the improved ability to identify MHC ligands using
methods trained on MS peptidome data (14,15), limited data is available on their impact for the
identification of T cell epitopes.

<na> The restricting MHC molecule of the ligands were analyzed and entries with alleles listed
unambiguously were selected. For example, some entries where the HLA alleles are listed as just
the gene name and alleles from chicken, horse, cow and mouse for which we did not have
binding prediction algorithms were excluded.

<q> What is the performance of Chiron?

<a> Table 1 and Figure 3 presents the accuracy of the four basecalling methods, including the Metrichor basecaller (the ONT
cloud service), Albacore (ONT official local basecaller), BasecRAWller14 and Chiron, on the data. Chiron has the highest
identity rate on the E. coli sample.

<a> In the cases where Chiron did not have the highest identity rate (Lambda and M. tuberculosis)
is was no more than 0.012 from the best. Additionally, it had the lowest mismatch rate on Lambda, M. tuberculosis and E. coli
(0.0403, 0.0307 and 0.0433), and the lowest insertion rate on Lambda and E. coli.

<a> In terms of speed on a CPU processor, Chiron is slower (21bp/s) than Albacore (2975bp/s) and - to a lesser extent -
BasecRAWller (81bp/s). However, when run on a Nvidia K80 GPU, we achieved a basecalling rate of 1652bp/s. (We also
tested Chiron on a Nvidia GTX 1080 Ti GPU and obtained a rate of 2657bp/s).

<na> For training and evaluating the performance of Chiron, we sequenced a phage Lambda virus (Escherichia virus Lambda
provided by ONT for calibrating the MinION device and an Escherichia coli (K12 MG1655) sample using 1D protocol on
R9.4 flowcells (See Methods).

<na> More extensive training on a broader
spectrum of species, including human can be expected to improve the performance of our model. There are also improvements
in accuracy to be gained from a better alignment of overlapping reads and consensus calling.

<na> An activation operation is performed after the convolution operation. Various kinds of activation functions can be chosen,
however, in this model we use a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function in the activation operation which has been reported to
have a good performance in CNN, defined as.

<na> All filters have the same channel number of 256. An element-wise addition is
performed on the two branches followed by a RELU activation function. A global batch normalisation operation is added after
every convolution operation. We tried a large kernel size (5,7,11) and different channel numbers (128,1024), and found the
above combination yielded the best performance.

<na> Here, we report the first deep learning model, named Chiron, that can directly translate
the raw signal to DNA sequence without the error-prone segmentation step.

<na> In this article we present Chiron, the first deep neural network model that can translate raw electrical signal directly to
nucleotide sequence. Chiron has a novel architecture which couples a convolutional neural network (CNN) with an RNN and a
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) decoder.

<a> Chiron presents an end-to-end basecaller, in that it predicts a complete DNA sequence from raw signal. It translates sliding
windows of 300 raw signals to sequences of roughly 10-20 base pairs (which we call slice). These overlapping slices are
stacked together to get a consensus sequence in real-time.

<q> Where to find cancer genomic data?

<a> Large scale collection of cancer genomic data, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (2)
and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (3), and expression repositories such as
NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (4) have enabled developments in prognostic and predictive
cancer models.

<na> M2EFM uses multiple levels of genomic data to infer disrupted regulatory patterns,
thus providing a gene signature that connects loss of regulatory control with cancer prognosis.

<na> The extreme heterogeneity of breast cancer makes one-size-fits all treatments difficult to achieve
and although a number of targeted therapies are available (1) personalized therapies work only
for a limited number of patients.

<na> In this work, we apply our own previously developed data
integration approach for combining gene expression and DNA-methylation data to model the
impact of regulatory disruption on breast cancer prognosis and prediction while also
incorporating prognostic clinical variables (10).

<na> A full description of data pre-processing appears in the Supplementary Methods. For this work,
we supplied a list of probes to M2EFM from a study of CpG loci involved in epigenetic field
effects in breast cancer based on data available in GEO (GSE69914).

<na> Aside from the probe list, five different breast cancer cohorts were used in this work. The first
dataset is referred to as TCGA, was used to train and test an OS model for breast cancer, and
consisted of gene expression and DNA methylation profiles created by TCGA, using the
Illumina HiSeq 2000 and Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 platforms, respectively.
Methylation data were functionally normalized (15) using the minfi package (16) in R.

<na> The fourth dataset is referred to as Hatzis1, was used to train and test a model of DRFS and
another model of pCR, and includes HER2-negative breast cancer cases with neo-adjuvant
treatment by taxane-anthracycline (followed by endocrine therapy for ER-positive cases).

<a> The fourth dataset is referred to as Hatzis1, was used to train and test a model of DRFS and
another model of pCR, and includes HER2-negative breast cancer cases with neo-adjuvant
treatment by taxane-anthracycline (followed by endocrine therapy for ER-positive cases) (13).
These data were assayed on the Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Array. They were
downloaded from GEO (GSE25055), and were normalized and then batch corrected in
conjunction with the following dataset.

<na> Selected variables include AJCC stage and patient age at diagnosis for all outcomes,
although stage was reduced to simply presence or absence of stage III cancer for DRFS and pCR
outcomes due to the absence of stage IV cases and small number of stage I cases for these
outcomes.

<na> Most prognostic markers for breast cancer have limited utility for patients with ER-negative
tumors (28). Unfortunately, ER status was not annotated in the Kao data, and there were too few
samples in Terunuma to effectively test the prognostic utility of our marker on ER-negative
patients.

<q> How the protonation states were assigned?

<a> The protonation
states of the titratable residues were assigned at pH 7 with PROPKA (Olsson et al., 2011) and
double-checked with the H++ server (Gordon et al., 2005).

<na> This success was fueled by the discovery of oxy- and
deoxy-hemoglobin crystal structures, which due to their different affinities were identified as the
R and T states respectively (Perutz, 1970, 1979).

<na> According to the tertiary two-state (TTS) model, which is a generalization of the MWC
theory, ligand affinity is directly controlled by the tertiary structure of each subunit, which can
exists in two states r and t with high and low affinity respectively, whose population is
determined by the nature of the quaternary state (R or T) (Henry et al., 2002).

<na> In this last case, these are the bridging moieties:
αE-αH-βB and αG-βG. It should be noted that intra-dimer α-β signalling is more important in fully
ligated and unligated forms than in the intermediate ligation states.

<na> In the seminal paper of van Wart et
al., the allosteric interaction in the HisH-HisF dimer was studied; binding at the allosteric site
produced a shift from 3.1-4.0 to 2.8-3.6 of the length distribution of the top 100 shortest paths
that link the allosteric site to the binding pocket (Van Wart et al., 2014).

<na> Moreover, it should be beared in mind that
equilibria are dictated by free energy differences. Therefore, cooperative binding might well
arise from purely dynamical effects or an altered vibrational entropy of the receptor upon ligand
binding (Cooper & Dryden, 1984; Popovych et al., 2006; Hilser, Wrabl & Motlagh, 2012;
Nussinov, Ruth & Chung-Jung, 2015) which could then propagate to the other protein chains.

<na> The aim is to
understand which of these amino acids are more responsible for inter-subunit communication,
how they are connected and which subunits exchange more information. In this way, the
sequence search space for future stability designs (to develop better blood substituents) can be
narrowed down.

<na> Hemoglobin is the paradigm of cooperative protein-ligand binding. Cooperativity is the
consequence of inter-subunit allosteric communication: binding at one site increases the affinity
of the others. Despite half a century of studies, the mechanism behind oxygen binding in
hemoglobin is not fully understood yet.

<na> t. In particular, it is not clear if cooperativity arises from
preferential inter-subunit channels and which residues propagate the allosteric signal from one
heme to the others. In this work, the heme-heme dynamical interactions have been mapped
through a network-based analysis of residue conformational fluctuations, as described by
molecular dynamics simulations.

<na> Although intra-dimer and α1-α2 communications are comparable in
α1- and β1-unligated, the former becomes more important when Hb is either saturated or
lacking ligands, the latter being the least relevant allosteric channel.

<q> In which organizms PDZ domains are found?

<a> We analyzed 7,852 PDZ domain-
containing proteins in 1,474 prokaryotes and fungi. PDZ domains are abundant in eubacteria;
and, this study confirms their occurrence also in archaea and fungi.

<a> Of all eubacterial PDZ
domain-containing proteins, 89% are predicted to be membrane and periplasmic, explaining the
depletion of bacterial domain forms in metazoan. Planctomycetes, myxobacteria and other
eubacteria occupying terrestrial and aquatic niches encode more domain copies, which may
have contributed towards multi-cellularity and prokaryotic-eukaryotic transition.

<na> The PSD-95/Dlg-A/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain is highly expanded and diversified in
metazoan where it is known to assemble diverse signalling components by virtue of interactions
with other proteins in sequence-specific manner.

<na> Over 93% of
the 7,852 PDZ-containing proteins classified into 12 families including 6 novel families. Out of
these 88% harbour eight different protease domains, suggesting their substrate-specificity is
guided by PDZ domains.

<na> The PDZ domain is one of such protein interaction domains. It was first identified in the context of signaling proteins,
which are referred to as GLGF repeats proteins or DHR (Discs large homology repeat) proteins
(Cho et al. 1992; Ponting and Phillips 1995).

<na> Metazoan PDZ domains are referred to as canonical PDZ domains and typically comprise
80-100 amino acid residues harboring a highly conserved fold (Doyle et al. 1996; Kennedy
1995). However, the length of secondary structures composed of six β-strands with a short and a
long α-helix may vary (Doyle et al. 1996; Morais Cabral et al. 1996).

<na> PDZ domains are inherently variable at primary sequence level, and show diversity in
functional roles and binding specificities in metazoan (Belotti et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2008;
Sakarya et al. 2007; Sakarya et al. 2010). The origin, diversity and functions of prokaryotic and
fungal PDZ domains are largely unknown.

<na> The 7,852 proteins containing altogether 9,975 PDZ-like domains were identified in 1,419 of
1,474 (96%) genomes.

<na> Many PDZ domain-containing proteins are reported to be periplasmic or intra-membrane
(Dartigalongue et al. 2001; Dong and Cutting 2004; Lipinska et al. 1990). Interestingly, the
domain is absent in 4% species (55 genomes), mainly belonging to cell-wall lacking mollicute
and candidatus phytoplasma species, of which many are adapted to parasitic lifestyle (Fig. 1).

<na> The domain is also absent in two Buchnera aphidicola species which are symbionts of a Cinara
(a conifer aphid) and in the archaean Nanoarchaeum equitans, a parasite on Ignicoccus hospitalis
on which it depends for lipids (Jahn et al. 2008).

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/184960

<q> What are the biases of next-gereation sequencing studies?

<a> Another source of bias in next-generation sequencing studies is the erroneous assignment of sample
identity to a read, or tag-switching. The mechanisms for this error are, to date, poorly explained and
seem to vary with platform (Sinha 2017, Carlson 2012).

<na> An example of a bioinformatic
method to estimate the rate of tag switching is shown, some recommendations on the use of positive
controls and primer choice are given, and one approach to reducing potential false positives resulting
from these technological biases is presented.

<na> The power of next generation sequencing
technologies like MiSeq, however, is balanced by its limits and biases, fueling a lively discussion on
their proper implementation in microbial ecology.

<na> Due to the possible biases of PCR, OTU splitting, and
tag-switching (Fig. 3), high minimum cutoffs were applied to all observations used in
downstream analyses. We subtracted 60 reads, or 1.0 x 10-5 of total wood endophyte library
size, from all observations of OTUs in each sample, and following this, observations with less
than 1 read were adjusted to zero.

<na> The approximately negative binomial curve of genomic controls, compared to the less dramatic
differences in abundances observed in our ITS-only positive controls (Fig. 5), suggests that much of the
potential bias within this study, and potentially amplicon sequencing studies in general, may originate
in the initial PCR step.

<na> Mock-community samples were used to estimate levels of tag-switching and
generate minimum read-abundances for observations, as well as gauge appropriate levels of similarity
for definition of OTUs, and to gain insight into levels of PCR amplification biases.

<na> Read abundances resulting from next generation sequencing studies with multiple samples and multiple
biological units of interest (e.g., “OTUs”, “ESVs”. etc., etc.) are an example of a multinomial,
“roll-of-the-dice” sampling process at both levels.

<na> ITS-amplicon metabarcode studies using the illumina MiSeq sequencing platform are the current
standard tool for fungal ecology studies. Here we report on some of the particular challenges
experienced while creating and using a ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) amplicon library for an
ecological study. Two significant complications were encountered.

<na> First, artificial differences in read
abundances among OTUs were observed, apparently resulting from bias at two stages: PCR
amplification of genomic DNA with ITS-region Illumina-sequence-adapted-primers, and during
Illumina sequencing.

<q> Which docking software was used together with Parapred?

<a> We show the usefulness of Parapred by integrating its predictions
with the PatchDock rigid protein docking algorithm
(Duhovny et al. [31]).

<na> PatchDock works with 2 protein molecules in the PDB
format and searches for suitable orientations for one of the
molecules—conventionally, the antigen—“onto” the other,
such that the two form an antibody-antigen complex.

<a> The usefulness of Parapred was measured by running
PatchDock with three potential binding sites of the antibody
molecule: (1) the CDRs, (2) the actual paratope and (3)
binding residues predicted by Parapred (residues with > 0.67
binding probability to match the number of residues in the
actual paratope).

<na> We recorded the best class decoy in the top 10 and top
200 decoys, as ranked by PatchDock, for each of the 30
structures.

<na> We conclude that for docking
simulations Parapred’s predictions are almost as informative
as the actual paratope.

<na> The use of RNN allows our model to learn complex longrange
dependencies between residues. This expressiveness
also comes at a cost of interpretability—it is difficult to
identify precisely which factors the model considers to be
the most important.

<na> We also showed that the
model’s predictions provide speed and quality gains for the
PatchDock rigid docking algorithm—decoy quality and timeto-dock
were comparable to ones obtained when the docking
algorithm has knowledge of the CDRs.

<na> In addition, as we
show in this work, accurate paratope prediction can improve
accuracy and speed of docking simulations, making structural
models more reliable and easier to obtain.

<na> We picked 30 antibody-antigen complexes
at random (highlighted in Appendix C) to be run through the
docking algorithm and used the remaining 209 to train the
model.

<na> We conclude that the deep-learning-based architecture
of Parapred is able to capture a richer set of features leading
to better classification, even though it uses less explicit
information about the antibody (Parapred does not require
structural data or any information about the antigen it binds
to).

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/173997

<q> What is dropout events in case of scRNA-seq?

<a> Due to the tiny amount of mRNAs in one cell (~0.01-2.5pg), the small mRNA copy number of each
gene in a cell (thousands of genes have only 1-30 mRNA copies) and the very low mRNA capture
efficiency (~5-25%, up to ~40%) (21-24), some mRNAs are totally missed during the reverse
transcription step and the following cDNA amplification step, and consequently undetectable in the
later sequencing step (3). This phenomenon is called dropout events (25,26).

<na> We call this type of zero
values as dropout zeros. On the other hand, because of the heterogeneity between cells and the
stochastic nature of transcription in a single cell, there is also a high chance that the expression level
of some genes are really zero when it is sequenced.

<na> Using this model, we can separate observed zero values as two parts to roughly reflect the proportion
of real zeros and dropout zeros due to very low expression level.

<na> Most dropout zeros are produced because of the very low mRNA capture efficiency (~5-25%, up to
~40%) and the small mRNA copy number of each gene (thousands of genes only have 1-30 mRNA
copies) in a cell (21-24).

<na> To add dropout events to the simulated data, we applied the dropout model introduced by Pierson
and Yau (26).

<na> Using this strategy, we simulated two types of scRNA-seq data: those with and without additional
dropout events. For each type of data, we simulated datasets with 10×2, 50×2, 100×2 and 200×2
cells, each with 10,000 simulated genes. We got 8 sets of simulation data in this way, 4 with dropout
events and 4 without.

<na> We can
see that DEsingle is almost always the best among the compared methods in the experiments, except
for the comparison of 10 vs 10 cells without additional dropout events (upper left panel in Figure 2), in
which DEsingle is the second best.

<na> The top 4 graphs are using simulation data
without additional dropout events while the bottom 4 graphs are using simulation data with dropout events. The
sample size for comparison is annotated above each graph.

<na> Differential expression analysis is one of the most important aspects for scRNA-seq data analyses
(3,6,25). The mixture of real zeros and dropout zeros in scRNA-seq data posed a great challenge to
DE genes detection (2,6,9).

<na> Results
showed that DEsingle outperforms existing methods for scRNA-seq DE analysis, and can reveal
different types of DE genes that are enriched in different functions.

<q> How fast RNAs degredade if storing long?

<a> First, long-term storage may degrade some unstable RNAs, though our results suggested that
the degradation is not substantial for sncRNAs. It has been proven for miRNAs that they remain
stable in severe conditions (Chen et al. 2008) and in circulation (Arroyo et al. 2011).

<a> Moreover, any RNA
found in serum stored up to 40 years is evidently quite stable, which is one of the critical criteria
for good biomarkers. Second, although all samples are processed in the same way, slight
differences in laboratory processing may still introduce some technical variance into expression
which cannot be removed totally.

<a> A previous study showed that miRNA (and other
sncRNA) discovery is possible in long-term archived serum samples (Rounge et al. 2015).

<na> For longer transcripts (e.g. messenger RNA (mRNA) or long non-coding
RNA (lncRNA)), we counted reads only mapped to exonic regions. However, this does not
mean that the non-exonic mapped reads are not important.

<na> For example, the MSA of tRNAs is 75 nts
long which can be seen at the bottom of the plots. The density plots shows the overall mapping
profiles and their x-axes also display nt positions.

<na> We also investigated biological and technical variation in expression, and the
results suggest that many RNA molecules identified in serum contain signs of biological
variation. They are therefore unlikely to be random degradation by-products.

<na> They are therefore unlikely to be random degradation by-products. In addition, the
presence of specific fragments of tRNA, snoRNA, Vault RNA and Y_RNA indicates protection
from degradation. Our results suggest that many circulating RNAs in serum can be potential
biomarkers.

<na> These circulating RNAs are usually packed in extracellular vesicles and have
considerable potential as minimally-invasive biomarkers (Yuan et al. 2016; An et al. 2015; Inns
and James 2015; Kim et al. 2017; Nolte-’t Hoen et al. 2012; Mitchell et al. 2008), since they are
stable and some have been associated with disease phenotypes (Inns and James 2015; Yuan
et al. 2016; Nomura 2017; Leidinger et al. 2013; Maierthaler et al. 2017).

<na> Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are another well-known member of sncRNA
molecules. They play a crucial role in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation (Kiss 2002) and can be
found as extracellular RNAs (Kim et al. 2017).

<na> Besides regulatory sncRNAs, protein-coding mRNAs and tRNAs are also
found as circulating RNAs (Yuan et al. 2016) despite their roles in protein synthesis.

<q> Where to find protein coding genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae?

<a> 5917 Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein-coding genes (reference strain s288c, NCBI taxon id 559292) were
downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)

<na> The concept of orphan genes was initially recognized when the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome was
completed [6–11]. It was believed that most of the orphans would disappear when more genomes would have been
sequenced, but this has not been the case [10, 12].

<na> Here, we set out to identify the orphans of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by using a group of Saccharomycetales
genomes. We explore the relationship of the number of orphans and their properties with different homology
detection tools (blastn, blastp, tblastn and HMMER) and on what genomes are included.

<na> To study the effects of these three factors we started with 5894 Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein coding
genes. We choose a set of fourteen Saccharomycetales fungi genomes of different evolutionary distance from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to detect homologs.

<na> This means that on average
the genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have hits in all but one of the target genomes. The much larger set of hits
with tblastn than with blastn clearly demonstrates the well-known fact that protein searches are more sensitive
then nucleotide searches.

<na> Several different estimates of the orphan proteins of S. cerevisiae have been proposed [10, 22, 35, 36].
Surprisingly, the list and properties of orphans vary between studies.

<na> Orphans might
also provide important functional clues about the phenotype or ecological niche of a particular organism [4, 5]. If
they truly do not have any homologs they must have been created by mutations turning non-coding DNA into a
protein coding gene.

<na> Homology search methods can either search the entire genome using the DNA sequences or only the annotated
proteins. Here we compare both type of methods therefore all annotated proteins from the fourteen proteomes
were downloaded from Uniprot [40].

<na> To detect orphans it is necessary to use a search tool to infer homology between genes. The search can be
performed using a database of proteins, or on full genomes.

<na> First, nucleotide-blast (blastn) was used to detect homology
between a gene in S. cerevisiae s288c and all the open reading frames in the other yeast genomes. Secondly
protein-blast (blastp) was used to search for homology between the annotated proteins.

<q> What neural network architecture might be used to predict RNA branchpoint locations from sequence?

<a> We used a bidirectional LSTM network to learn a mapping between RNA sequence and
branchpoint locations (Fig. 1c). We trained our model on the high confidence set of
branchpoints annotated by Mercer et. al. 2015.

<na> Furthermore, the small number of reads that are generated from
5’ss-branchpoint junctions provide imprecise information about branchpoint location due to
nucleotide skipping and transcript switching caused by the unusual 2’ OH linkage present.

<na> Experimental detection of RNA splicing branchpoints, the nucleotide serving as the nucleophile
in the first catalytic step of splicing, is difficult. To date, annotations exist for only 16-21% of 3’
splice sites in the human genome and even these limited annotations have been shown to be
plagued by noise.

<na> Our predicted branchpoints show large agreement with trends observed in the
raw data, but analysis of conservation signatures and overlap with pathogenic variants reveal
that our predicted branchpoints are generally more reliable than the raw data itself.

<na> The lack of branchpoint annotations has slowed our understanding of the basis of 3’ss
selection and diseases caused by mutations to branchpoint sequences themselves and the
trans-acting factors that recognize them.

<na> Throughout our study, we compare LaBranchoR to two recently proposed computational
methods, which focus on two distinct tasks: a machine learning approach for branchpoint
prediction, branchpointer, and a method to remove noise in the experimental data proposed by
Taggart et. al., 20174.

<na> In this study, we show that LaBranchoR has strong predictive performance, exceeding that
of previous methods. It also disregards noise in the experimental data leading to robust
predictions that are often more accurate than the raw data itself.

<na> Finally, we show that
LaBranchoR predictions overlap with more pathogenic variants than previous computational
predictions, as well as the raw data itself.

<na> Our predictions have a lower agreement with the Taggart set, where we find
that we overlap an experimental site for only 56% of 3’ss and 80% of the time we are within 4
nucleotides. Notably, restricting to Taggart sites with an A at the branchpoint yields a stronger
overlap of 71% and 84%, respectively.

<na> We use our
predicted branchpoints to identify a sequence element upstream of branchpoints consistent with
extended U2 snRNA base pairing, show an association between weak branchpoints and
alternative splicing, and explore the effects of variants on branchpoints.

<q> How many channels modern mass cytometers simultaneously detect?

<a> Currently, mass cytometers enable simultaneous detection
of 135 channels ranging from 75 to 209 atomic mass units. To date, more than 55 different
isotopes have been used for surface and intracellular protein epitope detection, DNA and
transcript detection, cell-cycle analysis, dead-cell exclusion, and cell barcoding.

<na> To assess the stability of the spillover matrix over time and
instruments, we measured single-stained beads on different mass cytometers over months
(Figure S3). Although the spillover matrix could be stable over months, our results show that
for optimal compensation the spillover matrix should be acquired simultaneously with the
sample of interest.

<na> The tuning procedure for mass cytometers ensures that the oxide ratio remains
under 3% for lanthanum (139La), an easily oxidized isotope. The third source of spillover is
due to the impurity of the isotopes used in mass cytometry.

<na> Due to the overlapping excitation and
emission spectra of the fluorescent dyes, signals are measured not only in the primary
channel, but also in neighboring channels.

<na> As the number of
parameters measured increases, however, it becomes challenging to detect proteins of low
abundance due to the increased complexity of overlapping spectra of fluorochromes that
interfere with detection in the affected channels.

<na> Due to the high mass resolution of the time-of-flight mass spectrometer and the fact that the
ions are singly charged and thus differ by at least a full atomic mass unit, the interference
between channels in mass cytometry is strongly reduced in comparison to the overlap
observed in fluorescent flow cytometry.

<na> The first is imprecision in ion detection (at mass M) caused
by small differences in ion positions and kinetic energy at the beginning of the mass analysis
process leading to signal leakage into adjacent mass channels (M±1).

<na> As
spillover is proportional to the originating signal, it can be reduced by decreasing antibody
concentrations; this also reduces the signal-to-noise ratio and is thus only applicable to
channels with clear positive and negative populations.

<na> Here we present a comprehensive workflow to estimate and systematically correct for signal
spillover across all the channels used in a given mass cytometry experiment. Polystyrene
capture beads were single-stained with each antibody used in the experiment. Beads were
then pooled and analyzed simultaneously in the mass cytometer.

<na> Fluorescent flow cytometry is affected by signal interference between channels. Since
spillover signal is a defined fraction of the source signal, it can be corrected
mathematically.

<q> How many genes in human are alternativly splices?

<a> Alternative splicing (AS) is a most important pre-mRNA processing to increase the diversity of
transcriptome and proteome in tissue- and development-dependent manners (Pan et al. 2008).
The estimates based on RNA-seq revealed that up to 94%, 60% and 25% of genes in human,
Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabdities elegans, respectively, undergo AS (Pan et al.
2008; Wang et al. 2008a; Gerstein et al. 2010; Graveley et al. 2011; Ramani et al. 2011).

<na> Supported by extended dataset from Roadmap/ENCODE
projects, we identified the alternative splicing of PBX1 as a novel candidate linking H3K36me3 to
embryonic stem cell fate decision.

<na> First, we used RNA-seq data to identify exons that are alternatively spliced during
hESC differentiation. We identified 3,513 mutually exclusive exons (MXE) and 3,678 skipped
exons (SE) that are differentially spliced between the hESCs and differentiated cells.

<na> Together,
these results demonstrate that alternative splicing depicts lineage- and developmental leveldependent
characterizations of hESC differentiation.

<na> Our results suggest the presence of a combinational mechanism involving HMs and AS, wherein
HMs facilitate the PSD and cell fate commitment by alternatively splicing the key components of
the ATM/ATR pathway (Figure S10). Additionally, many cell-cycle TF genes are involved in the
top enriched HM-associated AS gene set.

<na> This result suggests that the alternative splicing
of PBX1 is epigenetic regulated by H3K36me3 through the PSIP1/SRSF1 adaptor system. This
conclusion is strongly supported by a recent report using the HeLa cell line, which showed that
PBX1 is indeed a splicing target of SRSF1 (Anczukow et al. 2015).

<na> To quantitatively link HMs to alternative splicing upon hESC differentiation, the ChIP-seq data
were further processed by narrow peak calling. For each histone ChIP-seq dataset, the MACS
v2.0.10 peak caller (https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/) (Zhang et al. 2008; Feng et al. 2012) was
used to compare ChIP-seq signal to a corresponding whole cell extract (WCE) sequenced control
to identify narrow regions of enrichment (narrow peak) that pass a Poisson p-value threshold of
0.01.

<na> We performed integrative analyses on
transcriptomic and epigenomic data derived from human ESC (hESC) and five types of
differentiated cells. We identified thousands of AS exons and revealed their development- and
lineage-dependent characterizations.

<na> We considered four cell types directly
differentiated from H1 cells, including trophoblast-like cells (TBL), mesendoderm (ME), neural
progenitor cells (NPC), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (Figure S1A). We also considered
IMR90, a cell line for primary human fetal lung fibroblast, as an example of terminally differentiated
cells (Figure S1A).

<na> Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to be dynamic and play crucial roles in human ESC
differentiation (Gifford et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2013b). Given the aforementioned associations
between HMs and AS, and the well-established links between AS and hESC differentiation, we
hypothesized that the three HMs (H3K36me3, H3K27ac, and H4K8ac) may contribute to stem
cell differentiation through their associated AS events.

<q> How solvent accessible surface area of a protein is calculated?

<a> Solvent accessible surface area (ASA) was calculated for each protein atom by NACCESS [15]
which were then summed up for all atoms pertaining to the same residue.

<na> As elaborated in a series
of earlier studies [1,2,16,17], the burial (bur) of solvent exposure for any residue (X) embedded in a
polypeptide chain was defined by the solvent accessible surface area (ASA) of X located in the
protein divided by the ASA of the same amino acid in a Gly-X-Gly peptide fragment in its fully
extended conformation.

<na> The accurate determination of the local internal dielectric constant within proteins (as a function of
the degree of solvent exposure of amino acid residues) has been a well posed problem in the field
for decades.

<na> The Complementarity plot (CP) is an established graphical structure validation tool in the field of
protein science originally proposed for globular proteins [1–3] and later extended for
experimentally solved protein co-complexes.

<na> The subject has been further complicated by paradoxical
observations like the presence of ionic groups in the hydrophobic protein interior without having to
adapt to any specialized structures to get stabilized, demanding a considerably higher effect
experienced locally at these sites than can be accounted for by the low dielectric constant
traditionally assigned to represent the hydrophobic protein interior in continuum models.

<na> Note, that the corresponding agreement between the equivalent
single-valued term (EC) raised at protein-protein interfaces has already been reported (rmsd: 0.15,
Pearson's Correlation: 0.94) in a previous study.

<na> To that end, 1880 high resolution protein co-complex crystal structures were assembled from a
previously used database (DB3, see Methods); the (Sc, EC) values calculated at their interface
(precisely according to an earlier report [18]) and plotted in accordance with the previous
constructions of the plots [1].

<na> The cumulative probabilities of locating a point within the first and the
second contoured level were found to be in strong agreement with previous versions of the
complementarity plots constructed to score proteins in a residue wise manner.

<na> The fact that there is a 20% probability associated with attaining a negative EC at native interprotein
interfaces [18] is also reflected in the isolated islands at the negative half of EC in the plot.

<na> In the same
study, it was found that the electrostatic complementarity can as well be negative for top ranked
realistic docked protein complexes at a statistically non-negligible fraction (~21%), also true even
for native experimentally solved protein complexes (~20%).

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/185157

<q> Is salamander genome sequenced?

<a> To date, no salamander genome has
been sequenced to completion and only limited genomic data are available (Keinath et al.
2015; Habermann et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2009).

<na> One of the key challenges
for a whole genome assembly of this organism is dealing with repeat sequences. Surveys of
plethodontid salamanders suggest the most abundant to be members of the LTR/Gypsy
retrotransposon superfamily, with repeat lengths of the order of 7 kb, and so likely intractable
for assembly using short read approaches.

<na> The most common repeat identified within the VGW scaffolds was an unknown repeat
named ‘rnd-1_family-16’, which was masked 15,251 times with a consensus sequence of
only 155 bases. We believe that this repeat is likely derived from a small non-coding RNA or
retroposon similar to other repeats that have previously been observed in salamanders.

<na> This is a unique and invaluable resource for the field that will permit studies on evolutionary
genomics and the use of genomic molecular biology methods on a salamander model
species.

<na> We have demonstrated that the genome gigantism observed in salamanders does not
appear to be uniform across genic regions in the axolotl genome. Indeed, gene model
lengths in axolotl correlate with their orthologous lengths in human.

<na> Large repeat rich genomes present challenges for assembly and identification of
gene models with short read technologies. Here we present a method we call Virtual
Genome Walking which uses an iterative assembly approach to first identify exons from denovo
assembled transcripts and assemble whole genome reads against each exon.

<na> Yet these approaches can be costly and the difficulty of
sequencing and assembly scale non-linearly with genome size (Bradnam et al. 2013;
Simpson and Pop 2015). Genomes are complex and difficult to assemble for many reasons.
These can include GC bias, highly repetitive sequences, sheer scale or even financial
limitation.

<a> Thus, to date, a significantly detailed genomic sequence has not been generated for
a urodele amphibian. Limited sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) have
provided 24 sequences covering less than 0.01% of the axolotl genome, which is estimated
to be 30Gb, about 10 times the size of human (Smith et al. 2009).

<na> The axolotl genome is an intriguing candidate for sequencing with long read
approaches, especially those able to generate read lengths significantly exceeding the
length of typical repeats (Jain et al. 2017). However, given the availability of existing whole
genome sequence data (Keinath et al. 2015), we reasoned that targeted local assembly
around known protein-coding sequences could generate useful data characterising genic
regions from the axolotl.

<na> These resources would be useful for those seeking to exploit
common techniques to manipulate gene expression including targeted morpholinos,
CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and even ChIP-Seq.

<q> What are the virulence factors in S. pneumoniae?

<a> The capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis
(cps) locus, which encodes the serotype, is a major virulence factor in S. pneumoniae.

<na> By surveilling the circulating
serotypes, the epidemiological trends of S. pneumoniae can be observed, pre- and post-vaccination.
The rapid reduction in the cost of whole genome sequencing (WGS) has lead to its extensive use in
the monitoring of pneumococcal serotypes (Lang et al. 2015).

<na> There are a number of methods available to predict serotypes in S. pneumoniae. Besides the gold
standard method, Quellung, which can be subjective in certain cases, there are five additional methods
based on serological tests, at least eight semi-automated molecular tests based on PCR and one
method that uses microarray data for serotyping.

<na> The only fully-featured automated pipeline for serotyping S. pneumoniae WGS data is PneumoCat,
which was developed by Public Health England (PHE) (Kapatai et al. 2016).

<na> To show the scalability of SeroBA to large datasets, we took 9,477 S. pneumoniae samples from the
GPS project (Supplementary Table S2) and calculated the serotypes using the hardware setup
previously described.

<na> In this paper, we described SeroBA a method for predicting serotypes from S. pneumoniae Illumina
NGS reads. We compared SeroBA and PneumoCat to a gold standard experimental serotyping
method and showed that they had approximately the same level of concordance.

<na> This article describes SeroBA, a k-mer based method for predicting the serotypes of Streptococcus
pneumoniae from Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data.

<na> Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for 240,000 - 460,000 deaths in children under 5 years of
age each year. Accurate identification of pneumococcal serotypes is important for tracking the
distribution and evolution of serotypes following the introduction of effective vaccines.

<na> SeroBA can predict serotypes, by identifying the cps
locus, directly from raw whole genome sequencing read data with 98% concordance using a k-mer
based method, can process 10,000 samples in just over 1 day using a standard server and can call
serotypes at a coverage as low as 10x.

<na> However, the tool
described by Metcalf et al. is an in-house tool, and the tool described by Leung et al. only covers half
of the known serotypes.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/167544

<q> Where eqolisins are found?

<a> Eqolisins are rare acid proteases found in archaea, bacteria and fungi. Certain fungi
secrete acids as part of their lifestyle and interestingly these also have many eqolisin paralogs, up to
nine paralogs have been recorded.

<a> Eqolisins are acid proteases found in prokaryotes and fungi only.

<na> The three major families of acid or carboxyl peptidases recognized by MEROPS are the well
studied, pepstatin-sensitive, eukaryotic aspartic proteinases (A01, APs, for review see [1]), part of
the aspartic proteinase clan A; the more recently identified sedolisins (S53) and the also novel
eqolisins or glutamic peptidases (G01), both recently reviewed [2].

<na> However, since both sedolisins and eqolisins are typically active below pH 4, they
are interesting both from a fundamental and an applied angle. Here we study the eqolisins by means
of molecular evolution and dynamics, a study on sedolisins we recently reported elsewhere.

<a> Eqolisins have been described in archaea, bacteria [4] and fungi but, interestingly, are not found in
any non-fungal eukaryote [5]. Furthermore, eqolisins seem to have a rather unique and simple fold,
which makes them straightforward targets for structure-function prediction.

<na> Eqolisins are composed of two seven-stranded anti-parallel β-sheets that fold in parallel and
bend to form a structure resembling a half-pipe that forms the binding cleft (See Fig. 1).

<a> Then, since eqolisins have been
described only recently and appear restricted to fungi, bacteria and a few archaea, there is little
knowledge on which residues other than the catalytic Q53 and E136 are required.

<na> The complete preliminary MSA with all mentioned sequences can be found in S datafile 1. In order
to determine if the highly conserved positions, are indicative for additional strictly required amino
acids among functional eqolisins, we performed molecular dynamics.

<na> Three highly conserved glycine residues, G8, G41 and G44, found in the inner sheet together with
strictly conserved G55, are, given glycine's high degree of liberty, envisaged to play a role in
enzyme dynamics.

<na> Ten sequences have G43, a relatively large
number that, combined with its appearance in fungi, bacteria and archaea suggests this is another
acceptable substitution. Furthermore G is, given its high degree of liberty, often found at turns.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/127852

<q> What is the essence of D-statistic?

<a> A recent alternative to the above methods is the D-statistic. The D-statistic is based
on the di-allelic patterns of alleles between four groups of individuals, and provides a
way to test the correctness of a hypothetical genetic relationship between the four
groups (see Fig 1).

<a> A common tool for detecting ancient admixture events is the
D-statistic. The D-statistic is based on the hypothesis of a genetic relationship that
involves four populations, whose correctness is assessed by evaluating specific
coincidences of alleles between the groups.

<na> When working with high throughput sequencing data calling genotypes accurately is
not always possible, therefore the D-statistic currently samples a single base from the
reads of one individual per population. This implies ignoring much of the information in
the data, an issue especially striking in the case of ancient genomes.

<na> In the pivotal study [2] the D-statistic was used to show that 3 non-African
individuals are more genetically similar to the Neandertal sequence than African San
and Yoruban individuals are.

<na> Using the D-statistic on many Old World and Native Americans it has been
suggested gene flow into some Native American populations, such as evidence of
admixture from Australasian populations into New World Populations.

<na> The first use of the D-statistic was based on a sampling approach that allowed to
perform the test without the need to call SNPs or genotypes.

<na> The D-statistic is often applied to scenarios involving ancient individuals, that are
commonly affected by deamination, i.e. the natural degradation of DNA after death of
the organism that leads to there being few molecules remaining in ancient specimens
and often results in a low sequencing depth.

<na> The current methods for the D-statistic can be very ineffective and
unreliable when applied to ancient data, since both sampling and genotype calling
procedures are subject to high uncertainty.

<na> We also illustrate that it is possible to correct for type-specific
error rates in the data, so that the reads used to calculate the D-statistic will not bias
the result due to type-specific errors.

<na> This section introduces the traditional D-statistic and the theory that leads to its
approximation as a normal distribution. Thereafter we explain how to extend the
D-statistic to use multiple individuals per population, without genotype calling and still
preserving the same approximation property of the D-statistic.

<q> How sequences of RNA bound to AGO are experimentaly obtained?

<a> High throughput sequencing in combination with immunoprecipitation (IP) techniques have made
possible to determine the sequences of sRNA that are bound to different AGO families. AGO-IP
experiments have been performed for AGO1, AGO2, AGO4, AGO5, AGO6, AGO7, AGO9 and
AGO10.

<a> Here we train support vector machines (SVM) on sRNA sequencing data
obtained from AGO-immunoprecipitation experiments to identify features that determine sRNA affinity
to specific AGOs.

<na> Furthermore, direct
experimental evidence show that mutating the 5’ nucleotide of a sRNA can redirect its AGO
destination (14); however, other relevant features, such as sequence motifs encoded by the primary
structure appear to play a role (7, 15-18).

<a> Here we train
support vector machines (SVM) on sRNA sequencing data obtained from AGO-IP experiments to
identify features that determine sRNA affinity to specific AGOs.

<na> In addition to the 5-fold cross-validation
scheme we also validated the classification system using 37 additional A. thaliana AGO-IP datasets
that were never seen during the training phase by the classifier. These validation datasets were
collected from different tissues and experimental conditions, which allowed us to evaluate the
robustness of the classifier.

<na> In layer 3, a balanced dataset composed of sRNAs from all 8 AGO groups available was created.
Decision values were computed for each of the sequences using the classifiers obtained for layer 2,
and served as input for a 5-fold cross-validation procedure used to train and test the inference
scheme applied to the 3rd layer.

<na> Interestingly, when looking to the performance obtained for the ta-siRNA dataset, we observed high
sensitivity values both for the set isolated for Arabidopsis (~80%) and also for the complete plant set
(~95%).

<na> Important
transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing mechanisms can be activated depending on the
specific AGO protein to which sRNA bind. It is known that sRNA-AGO associations are at least partly
encoded in the sRNA primary structure, but the sequence features that drive this association have not
been fully explored.

<na> The “noAGO” set was
used in the SVM training in combination with AGO-IP data to learn discriminative rules to identify
sequences with low potential to load to an AGO and therefore with small chance of becoming
functional sRNAs.

<na> We developed a supervised machine learning approach rooted in the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
algorithm to learn classifiers capable of determining AGO-sRNA affinity from the sRNA sequences
alone (Supplementary Notes).

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/178624

<q> Where to find scRNA-seq datasets?

<a> We analyzed four single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets
in this study. Data were mostly downloaded from the single-cell portal (https:
//portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell). Two of these datasets were originally
used to study intra-tumour heterogeneity and the tumour-microenvironment in metastatic
melanoma3 and oligodendroglioma44, respectively.

<na> For all the scRNA-seq datasets, we used principal component
analysis (as a noise-reduction preprocessing step1, 19) to project the cells into a 100-
dimensional space, and used the projected coordinates in the 100-dimensional spaces as
inputs to scvis.

<na> We then use scvis to analyze four single-cell
RNA-sequencing datasets, exemplifying interpretable two-dimensional representations
of the high-dimensional single-cell RNA-sequencing data.

<na> Single-cell datasets are typically high-dimensional in large numbers of measured cells. For
example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can theoretically measure the expression
of all the genes in tens of thousands of cells in a single experiment.

<na> Third, t-SNE is not scalable to large datasets because it has a time complexity
of O(N2D) and space complexity of O(N2), where N is the number of cells, and D is the
number of expressed genes in the case of scRNA-seq data.

<na> We extensively tested our method on simulated data and several scRNA-seq
datasets in both normal and malignant tissues to demonstrate the robustness of our method.

<na> Although scRNA-seq
dataset have high dimensionality, their intrinsic dimensionalities are typically much lower.
For example, factors such as cell type and patient origin explain much of the variation
in a study of metastatic melanoma.

<na> We run the Adam stochastic gradient descent algorithm,
for 500 epochs for each dataset with at least 3,000 iterations by default. For large datasets,
running 500 epochs is computationally expensive, we therefore run the Adam algorithm for
a maximum of 30,000 iteration or two epochs (which is larger).

<na> Although t-SNE (with default parameter setting) uncovered the six clusters in this dataset,
it was still challenging to infer the overall layout of the six clusters.

<na> We next analyzed the scvis
learned probabilistic mapping from a training single-cell dataset, and tested how it performed
on unseen data. We first trained a model on the mouse bipolar cell of the retina dataset,
and then used the learned model to map the independently generated mouse retina dataset.

<q> What datasets were used to evaluate accuracy of iCNV?

<a> To evaluate the accuracy of iCNV, and also to serve as illustration, we
analyze two set of samples from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing
Project. The first set contains 38 unrelated individuals with SNP array
and WES data. The second set comprises of 75 related individuals with
SNP array and WGS data.

<na> An integrated cross-platform analysis is expected to
improve resolution and accuracy, yet there is no tool for effectively combining data from sequencing
and array platforms.

<na> We compare integrated two-platform CNV detection using iCNV to naïve intersection
or union of the two platforms and show that iCNV increases sensitivity and robustness. We also
assess the accuracy of iCNV compared to existing methods on WGS data only, and show that the
utilization of allele-specific reads improve CNV detection accuracy.

<na> It is yet unclear
in such studies how to combine data from multiple platforms, and
how such multi-platform integration can improve accuracy.

<na> Compared to existing approaches,
iCNV improves copy number detection accuracy in three ways: (1) utilization
of B allele frequency, and (2) integration of sample matched SNParray
data when available, and (3) adoption of platform-specific normalization.

<na> We have proposed a method, iCNV, to improve CNV detection and
genotyping accuracy using high throughput sequencing data, allowing
for integration of SNP-array data.

<na> Our results, based on spike-ins and pedigree-based quality evaluations,
show that SNP-arrays give a significant boost in accuracy to WES but
relatively little gains for WGS.

<na> CNVs detected by iCNV have higher
within-family sharing than the other methods being compared, suggesting
a higher accuracy. Collectively, iCNV provides a systematic framework
for single and cross platform CNV detection.

<na> How much does SNP-array data add to NGS data for CNV detection?
Our results, based on spike-ins and pedigree-based quality evaluations,
show that SNP-arrays give a significant boost in accuracy to WES but
relatively little gains for WGS.

<na> To further evaluate performance, we utilize pedigree data that is available
for the 75 individuals with WGS and array data. CNV detections that
are true positives are more likely to be shared between related individuals
than between unrelated individuals.

<q> Where PKS is well explored?

<a> PKS and NRPS are very well explored in genomes from cultivable organisms, mainly
Actinomycetes [21] and Cyanobacteria [22]. Recently, by using a metagenomic approach,
studies have demonstrated the presence of these metabolite-genes in aquatic environments,
as for example, Brazilian coast waters (in free living and particle-associated bacteria) and
from the microbiomes of Australian marine sponges.

<na> It has the potential to
explore uncultivable microorganisms by accessing and sequencing their nucleic acid [1]. In
recent years, due to decreasing costs of DNA sequencing - metagenomic databases [2] (e.g.,
MG-RAST) have rapidly grown and archive billons of short read sequences [3].

<na> These
genomes were screened for secondary metabolism genes, such as polyketide synthases
(PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS), using the Anti-SMASH and
NAPDOS workflows.

<na> Polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS) are two families
of modular mega-synthases, both are very important for the biotechnological and
pharmaceutical industry due to their broad spectrum of products, spanning from antibiotics
and antitumor drugs to food pigments.

<na> PKS enzymes can be classified in types (I, II and III), where type I can be further classified
into modular or iterative classes. The iterative PKS use the same domain many times,
iteratively, to synthetize the polyketide.

<na> Type I PKS are characterized by multiple domains in the same open reading frame (ORF)
while in type II each domain is encoded in a separate ORF, acting interactively.

<na> Most of the studies aim to solely find specific domains,
like Keto-synthase (KS) in PKS and Condensation domain (C) in NRPS, due to the high
conservation of these domains.

<na> This study aims to (i)
generate draft genomes from Lake Stechlin; (ii) to screen these genomes for new complete
multi-modular enzymes from PKS and NRPS families, exploring their diversity and
phylogeny.

<na> Figure 1b shows the taxonomical classification at phylum level for the bins showing NRPS,
type I PKS and hybrid clusters. Supplementary table S3 shows the distribution of all
clusters in all bins.

<na> From the 15 bins containing NRPS and/or type I PKS clusters, only 4 showed significant
difference between the 3 groups. Bins 1 and 2 are more abundant in PA samples and bins
193 and 235 are more abundant in the FL samples.

<q> What proteases do in vivo?

<a> Proteases or peptidases degrade proteins by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. They are involved in
various biological processes as cell death [1], nutrition [2] and infections [3].

<na> Sedolisins are acid proteases that are related to the basic subtilisins. They have been identified in all
three superkingdoms but are not ubiquitous, although fungi that secrete acids as part of their
lifestyle can have up to six paralogs.

<na> Proteases are
classified, primarily based on the catalytic mechanism, into several classes among which aspartic,
cystein, metallo and serine proteases.

<na> Proteases can also be classified based on other
characteristics. A major difference can be made between endo- and exopeptidases, where the latter
include di- and tripeptidyl peptidases. Among exopeptidases one can discriminate carboxy- and
aminopeptidases.

<na> The most common proteases are serine proteases in which a serine serves as the nucleophylic amino
acid in the catalytic site.

<na> This confirms that the CSIs not necessarily affect the basic functional fold of subtilisin-like
proteases. Although in the absence of homologous template the prediction of the loop structures
formed by the CSIs is not very reliable, the model does allow some general predictions.

<na> Next we considered how evolution might have occurred. As stated before, we have no
insight in the exact functional characteristics of the ancestral protein. This might have been an endosedolisin,
a TPP or a protease capable of both reactions.

<na> Both endo and TPP activity has been shown for non-fungal
sedolisins, hence, as such we have no indication regarding the state of the ancestral enzyme. In
addition, at least Human TPP has been shown to have endo activity at low pH.

<na> Because structure determines function we wondered if the CSIs would interfere in the core
structure of the protein or if they might appear as solvent exposed loops. We created a model of
SED_A and structurally aligned it with 3EE6.

<na> This confirms that the CSIs not necessarily affect the basic functional fold of subtilisin-like
proteases. Although in the absence of homologous template the prediction of the loop structures
formed by the CSIs is not very reliable, the model does allow some general predictions.

<q> What is Hetionet?

<a> First, we constructed
Hetionet (neo4j.het.io), an integrative network encoding knowledge from millions of biomedical
studies. Hetionet v1.0 consists of 47,031 nodes of 11 types and 2,250,197 relationships of 24
types. Data was integrated from 29 public resources to connect compounds, diseases, genes,
anatomies, pathways, biological processes, molecular functions, cellular components,
pharmacologic classes, side effects, and symptoms.

<a> In this study, we developed a
hetnet (Hetionet v1.0) by integrating knowledge and experimental findings from decades of
biomedical research spanning millions of publications. We adapted an algorithm originally
developed for social network analysis and applied it to Hetionet v1.0 to identify patterns of efficacy
and predict new uses for drugs.

<na> We refer to this study as Project Rephetio (pronounced as rep-het-ee-oh). Both Rephetio and
Hetionet are portmanteaus combining the words repurpose, heterogeneous, and network with the
URL het.io.

<na> We obtained and integrated data from 29 publicly available resources to create Hetionet v1.0
(Figure 1). The hetnet contains 47,031 nodes of 11 types (Table 1) and 2,250,197 relationships of
24 types (Table 2).

<na> These edges were compiled from 10,646 distinct publications, which Hetionet binding edges
reference as an attribute. Binding edges represent a comprehensive catalog constructed from low
throughput experimentation.

<na> Hetionet v1.0 contains 24 edge types (metaedges). For each metaedge, the
table reports the abbreviation, the number of edges, the number of source nodes connected by the
edges, and the number of target nodes connected by the edges.

<na> Each of these queries was simple to write and
took less than a second to run on our publicly available Hetionet Browser. While it is possible that
existing services provide much of the aforementioned functionality, they offer less versatility.

<na> Hetionet differentiates itself in its ability to flexibly query across multiple domains of information. As
a proof of concept, we enhanced the biological process query (b), which identified processes that
were enriched for disease-associated genes, using multiple sclerosis (MS) as an example disease.
The verbose Cypher code for this query is shown below:

<na> The integrative potential of Hetionet v1.0 is reflected by its connectivity. Among the 11 metanodes,
there are 66 possible source–target pairs. However, only 11 of them have at least one direct
connection. In contrast, for paths of length 2, 50 pairs have connectivity (paths types that start on
the source node type and end on the target node type, see Figure 1C).

<na> Hetionet v1.0 is accessible via a Neo4j Browser at https://neo4j.het.io. This public Neo4j instance
provides users an installation-free method to query and visualize the network.

<q> What is the input for R2DGC?

<na> R2DGC is designed to take individual sample files containing basic peak
information and perform pre-processing steps, generate an alignment
table with areas of peaks common to multiple samples, and match
aligned peaks to a reference library (Fig. 1).

<a> The input for peak alignment with R2DGC is a list of file
paths to individual sample files that contain the retention times, area, and
mass spectra of each peak as commonly outputted by vendor software
like ChromaTOF (Supplemental Section 2.2).

<na> We have extensively tested the package on both known mixtures of
metabolite standards, and extracts derived from tissues and cell lines. We
provide results from two such test cases to demonstrate the utility of the
package (https://github.com/rramaker/R2DGC_Datasets).

<na> R2DGC provides a comprehensive, efficient, and reproducible pipeline
for 2D-GCMS peak alignment and identification. It is one of the few
freely available and actively maintained 2D-GCMS aligners currently
available and improves upon existing software by (1) calculating optimal
retention time or mass spectra similarity thresholds rather than an arbitrary
designation, (2) facilitating the use of retention time standards to
allow for universally reproducible alignments, (3) filtering ions that
hinder mass spectra comparisons, (4) and providing compatibility for
multiple peak quantification methods.

<na> If retention time
standard indexing is desired, the user also includes retention time standard
peaks with each metabolite standard, using a naming scheme identical
to the sample file input described above.

<na> Furthermore, subjecting metabolites to electron
spray ionization, the most common ionization method for 2D-GCMS,
can lead to similar mass spectras among structurally related compounds.
However, combining these three components provides a powerful
method for deconvoluting complex mixtures.

<na> Metabolomics data processing and analysis can be divided into three
steps. First, raw signal is processed to distinguish analyte peaks from
background noise and relative peak areas and spectra are computed.

<na> If quant mass incongruencies exist, the user is notified
and a preliminary peak area conversion is performed. If primary or
secondary retention time standards were used, the user simply needs to
ensure a consistent naming scheme is used to identify each standard peak
and make use of retention time indexing.

<na> We find our alignment
pipeline performs comparably to two previously developed open
source alignment pipeline (Castillo et al., 2011; Jeong et al., 2012) often
resulting in more true alignments and fewer incorrect or missing alignments.

<na> t: The final and only required function
(ConsensusAlign) takes sample files and an optional metabolite standard
library and aligns common peaks across samples.

<q> What is enhancer?

<a> Enhancers are defined as regulatory DNA regions that activate transcription of target genes in a
distance- and orientation-independent manner.

<na> Enhancers have emerged as regulatory DNA elements crucial for transcriptional activation of gene
expression. Using cap analysis of gene expression and epigenetic data, we identify on large-scale
transcribed enhancers in mouse macrophages, their time kinetics and target protein-coding genes.

<na> We
observe an increase in target gene expression, concomitant with increasing numbers of associated
enhancers and find that genes associated to many enhancers show a shift towards stronger enrichment for
macrophage-specific biological processes.

<na> Finally, we show that enhancer regions are enriched for binding sites of
inflammation-related transcription factors, suggesting a link between stimuli response and enhancer
transcriptional control.

<na> Our study provides new insights into genome-wide enhancer-mediated
transcriptional control of macrophage genes, including those implicated in macrophage activation, and
offers a detailed genome-wide catalogue to further elucidate enhancer regulation in macrophages.

<na> According to the dominant model, transcriptional
regulation by enhancers is exerted via direct physical interaction between enhancer and target gene
promoter mediated by DNA looping.

<na> Enhancer
sequences contain transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) that recruit transcription factors (TFs) to
regulate target genes.

<na> Recent studies have led to the unexpected finding that most active enhancers recruit RNA polymerase
II and are bi-directionally and divergently transcribed to produce RNA transcripts, referred to as
eRNAs3.

<na> With these data, we established a catalogue of transcribed enhancer regions linked to
their target genes. This catalogue provides insights into genome-wide enhancer-mediated regulation of
transcription in mouse macrophages.

<na> These two peak sets were used for
identification of enhancers and annotation of protein-coding gene promoters, respectively. Tag counts of
all TSSs composing a CAGE peak were summed up to derive a total tag count for that CAGE peak.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/175943

<q> Where to find a DNA read data?

<a> The MinION (R9.4) dataset (14 million reads, 90 billion bases) is from rel3 at
https://github.com/nanopore-wgs-consortium/NA12878 (Jain et al. doi:10.1101/128835).
The PacBio (P5-C3) dataset (30 million reads, 197 billion bases) is from accession
SRX627421 [15].

<na> While the lower DNA read shows 12-fold
tandem multiplication, the upper read has two missing fragments: these two
parts of the read are unaligned. A plausible explanation is that the alignment
method simply failed to align these fragments, perhaps because of sequencing
errors.

<na> The
inserted part of the DNA read in Fig. 4B aligns here with 192 matches, 15
mismatches, and 64 gaps. This alignment has much higher probability than the
second-best hit (187 matches, 20 mismatches, 82 gaps), to a retro-RPL23A on
chromosome 19 with 97.7% identity to the parent mRNA.

<na> Another approach would be to automatically recognize if more than one
DNA read has the same rearrangement, not merely overlapping rearrangements.
This is not trivial, because two reads with the same rearrangement can have
non-identical alignments due to sequencing error.

<na> If we could reconstruct the most recent common ancestor of all extant human
genomes, it would be an ideal reference for human nucleotide sequences. Almost
every part of any human DNA read would be descended from a unique part of
the reference.

<na> Long-read DNA sequencing methods (e.g. PacBio,
nanopore) are promising for this task, because one read may encompass a
whole complex mutation.

<na> We apply it to nanopore and PacBio reads
from one human cell line (NA12878), and survey sequence rearrangements,
both real and artifactual.

<na> Short-read DNA sequencing can provide high-throughput baselevel
resolution (e.g. [9, 10]); however, the read length limits the types of structural
variation detected, and limits reliable alignment to repetitive regions [11],
including subtelomeric regions that are known to harbor rearrangements.

<na> Long-read DNA sequencing technologies provide read lengths to span tens
of kilobases and beyond, which enables investigation of complex rearrangements
spanned by one read.

<na> There is often ambiguity in how to align rearranged
fragments of a read, for example in gene conversion (replacement of a DNA
segment by a duplicate of a similar segment). Such ambiguity can be resolved
by calculating the probabilities of alternative alignments, based on the probabilities
of substitutions and gaps due to sequencing error.

<q> Where to find proteome of Triticum aestivum?

<a> As a test case for evaluation and application of the methods, we used proteome of bread wheat,
i.e., Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. In 2014, the International Wheat Genome
Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) published a highly fragmented chromosome-by-chromosome
survey sequence of the bread wheat genome (International Wheat Genome Sequencing
Consortium (IWGSC) 2014). The same year, Choulet et al. (2014) published a high-quality
reference sequence of bread wheat chromosome 3B.

<na> Finally, we applied the methods to the rest of the wheat survey sequence to infer split genes in
bread wheat proteome.

<na> We developed two approaches and showcase their good performance on a challenging
proteome of hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring).

<na> One
approach collapses branches with low bootstrap support and the other computes a likelihood
ratio test. We extensively validated these methods by 1) introducing and recovering
fragmentation on the bread wheat, Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, chromosome 3B; 2)
by applying the methods to the low-quality 3B assembly and validating predictions against the
high-quality 3B assembly; and 3) by comparing the performance of the proposed methods to the
performance of existing methods, namely Ensembl Compara and ESPRIT.

<na> As customary in the field, we determine the quality of the methods by measuring the precision
and recall. Here the recall measures the proportion of fragmented genes that the methods can
identify. The precision penalises for erroneous predictions by measuring the proportion of
predictions that are indeed fragmented genes.

<na> As input candidate pairs, we identify, among all the protein sequences of a target genome,
those that belong to the same gene family—either established by Ensembl Compara or defined
as deepest hierarchical orthologous groups as inferred by OMA (Altenhoff et al. 2013)).

<na> For both measures, we simulated fragmentation
on the wheat 3B reference sequence. In a subsequent experiment, we applied the tests to the
wheat 3B survey sequence and validated predictions using the wheat 3B reference sequence.
In this case the total number of fragmented genes is unknown, so we could only count the
number of correct and wrong predictions, and calculate the precision.

<na> Despite technological and algorithmic advances, genome assembly and annotation remains a
challenge, especially for large polyploid genomes with complex evolutionary histories. Genes
often remain fragmented and fragments get annotated as separate genes.

<na> The two main inherent challenges of in-silico split gene inference are the confounding effect of
close paralogs and the variation in the rate of evolution along the sequences. Indeed,
sometimes fragments come from identical or nearly identical paralogs and there is not enough
information to distinguish fragments belonging to one gene from another. Hence, we are more
likely to make a false positive prediction.

<na> Our approach demonstrates
the power of fine-grained evolutionary inferences across multiple species to improving genome
assemblies and annotations. An open source software tool is available at
https://github.com/DessimozLab/esprit2.

<q> What is haustoria in fungi?

<a> Rust fungi, powdery mildews and oomycetes can form dedicated
feeding structures called haustoria that act as sites of effector delivery to the plant cell cytoplasm (Garnica et
al., 2014).

<na> Reads for germinated spores and haustorial tissue (100bp paired-end) were obtained from NCBI BioProject
PRJNA253722 (Upadhyaya et al., 2014).

<na> Lastly, we used RNA sequencing data for germinated spores (urediniospores) and haustorial tissue from the
wheat stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici 21-0 (Upadhyaya et al., 2014) and performed
differential expression analysis.

<na> For genes with high up-regulation in haustoria that encode secreted proteins,
ApoplastP predicts only 9.1% as apoplastic (Table 7). This is consistent with the haustorial structure in rust
fungi, in which the extra-haustorial matrix is thought to be separated from the plant apoplast by a neckband
and the role of haustoria as the main site of cytoplasmic effector delivery.

<na> In contrast, a simple classifier using a threshold of at least four cysteines as a criterion
for apoplastic localization returns 30.9% of secreted proteins that are encoded by genes with high up-
regulation in haustoria as apoplastic.

<na> Pathogenic microbes such as bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, and nematodes colonize and infect plant cells and
cause devastating diseases and crop losses.

<na> This suggests that thresholds for cysteine content do not allow for
highly accurate discrimination of apoplastic effectors from cytoplasmic effectors in fungi (Table 2). For
example, a small size and high cysteine content are also found in intracellular fungal effectors such as the
Melampsora lini effectors AvrP123 (117 aas, 11 cysteines) and AvrP4 (95 aas, 7 cysteines).

<na> On the set of effectors that share no overlap with the training data,
ApoplastP improves accuracy by 12.5% for fungi and by 13.7% for oomycetes (Table 3).

<na> Unconventionally secreted proteins from fungi include the Cts1 endochitinase from Ustilago maydis with a
putative apoplastic localization and this is also predicted as apoplastic by ApoplastP.

<na> We used an independent test set of 32 apoplastic effectors from fungi, oomycetes and nematodes to assess
the true positive rate (correctly identified apoplastic proteins) of ApoplastP.

<d> doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/202168

<q> How recombination rates affect neutral sites?

<a> Low recombination rates make it difficult for linked neutral sites to escape the effects of new mutations via recombination.

<na> We quantified the speciation continuum using hybrid zone width and genetic distance between
pairs. Chromosome size, proximity to chromosome ends and centromeres may influence
genomic differentiation as they have shown associations with recombination rates (Butlin
2005; Smukowski and Noor 2011).

<na> In support of this suggestion, recombination rates (approximated by GC content) and gene densities, two genomic features that are preserved
across birds and promote linked selection were consistent predictors of repeatability in FST.
Genetic drift may also contribute to the correlations we documented.

<na> These factors could include genomic features (e.g., areas of low
recombination) that promote processes like linked selection (positive or purifying selection
that affects linked neutral sites) at specific genomic regions. Examinations of repeatable
patterns of differentiation across population pairs can provide insight into the role of these
factors.

<a> For example, genomic regions with lower rates of recombination, higher rates
of mutation and elevated gene densities can promote linked selection, defined as any form of
selection that reduces variation at nearby neutral sites.

<na> We also (3) use linear
models to implicate specific genomic features in generating repeatable patterns of genomic
differentiation; these features include proxies for both recombination and mutation rates, gene
density, chromosome size and proximity to chromosome ends and centromeres.

<na> Birds are well suited for this work as a considerable
amount of information is known about speciation in this group (Price 2008) and genomic
features are highly conserved across this group; birds have stable chromosome numbers, low
rates of interchromosomal rearrangements, high synteny and similar recombination.

<na> For example, if the recombination landscape has remained the same for millions of
years, recurrent linked selection in areas of low recombination has likely been reducing
variation over the same time period and these reductions will be passed down over speciation
events (Burri 2017).

<na> We used GC content as a proxy for recombination. Recombination affects the patterns
of local base composition via the unbalanced transmission of ‘strong’ (GC) over ‘weak’ (AT)
alleles at double-strand breaks (Mugal et al. 2015).

<na> Analyses were limited to windows with data from all pairs and windows
with more than 5000 callable sites, as dXY can be highly variable with small sample sizes and
coverage (e.g., Clarkson et al. 2014).

<q> How extraintestinal variants of Salmonella enterica have evolved?

<a> Host-restricted,
extraintestinal variants of Salmonella enterica have evolved independently multiple times
from gastrointestinal ancestors (Bäumler and Fang 2013), and show a greater degree of
gene degradation compared to their generalist relatives (Parkhill et al. 2001; McClelland et
al. 2004; Thomson et al. 2008).

<na> Here we
integrate a method for scoring the functional impact of mutations with a random forest
classifier, and apply this to the classification of Salmonella enterica strains associated with
extraintestinal disease.

<na> While pathogen and host requirements for infection vary, there is increasing
evidence of parallel evolution in bacteria adapting to the same or similar host niche. This is
perhaps nowhere more evident than in the species Salmonella enterica.

<na> Salmonella enterica strains that cause disease in warm-blooded mammals lie on a spectrum
from those that have a broad host range and cause self-limiting gastrointestinal infection, to
those that are more restricted in host range, but cause systemic disease and are typically
associated with higher mortality (Rabsch et al. 2002; Feasey et al. 2012).

<na> Indeed, we have previously shown that functional variant calling,
based on sequence deviation from patterns of conservation observed in deep sequence
alignments, shows a similar functional signal in host-restricted Salmonella enterica serovar
Gallinarum to pseudogene analysis (Wheeler et al. 2016), identifying a larger cohort of
genes where constraints on drift appear to have been lifted during host-adaptation.

<na> Genomes for 13 Salmonella enterica serovars were retrieved from the NCBI database
(accessions and serovar information can be found in S1 Table). The serovars were divided
into gastrointestinal and extraintestinal serovars according to the classifications made by
Nuccio and Bäumler (2014).

<na> By training our random forest classifier to discriminate gastrointestinal and invasive
serovars of Salmonella, using a small and well-characterised training dataset, we are able to
additionally discriminate recently emerged Salmonella Enteritidis and Typhimurium lineages
associated with invasive disease in immunocompromised populations in sub-Saharan Africa.
Importantly, our classifier produces interpretable lists of gene variants associated with
extraintestinal disease.

<na> The approach taken in this investigation is summarised in Fig 1, and described below. We
built our model using a collection of genomes from well-characterised reference strains of
gastrointestinal and extraintestinal Salmonella serovars (Supplemental Table S1), drawing
on the extensive curation of orthology relationships performed by Nuccio and Bäumler
(2014).

<na> These strains were originally characterised as “gastrointestinal” or “extraintestinal”
based on common patterns of gene degradation, host restriction and clinical characteristics
observed among the extraintestinal strains (Nuccio and Bäumler 2014), and we have
employed this same categorisation our analysis.

<na> Mutations in different strains are colour-coded, with bars in red indicating a mutation in an
extraintestinal strain and bars in blue indicating a mutation in a gastrointestinal strain. An
estimate of the effect of the mutation on protein function (DeltaBS) is shown on the y-axis,
with positive values indicating higher chance of a mutation being deleterious to protein
function. The x-axis represents the length of the protein.

<q> What could be used as a model in commonly for human neutrophil behavior?

<a> The HL-60 cell line and its PLB-985 sub-line are commonly used as a model for human neutrophil
behavior, but how closely gene expression in differentiated cells resembles that of primary neutrophils
has remained unclear.

<na> However, combining DMSO with the serum-free-supplement
Nutridoma resulted in an increased chemotactic response and cell surface expression of the neutrophil
markers FPR1 and CD11b without a cost in viability.

<a> Furthermore, the gene expression pattern of the
differentiated cell lines correlated slightly better with that of human neutrophils than the mouse
neutrophil pattern did. Finally, we created a publicly available gene expression database that is searchable
by gene name and by protein domain content, where users can compare gene expression in HL-60, PLB-
985 and primary human and mouse neutrophils.

<na> Our neutrophil gene expression database will
be a valuable tool to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between the cell lines and
primary neutrophils, to compare expression levelsfor genes of interest, and to improve the design of tools
for genetic perturbations.

<na> hey are generated from myeloid precursors in the bone marrow,
where they undergo several stages of maturation, namely myeloblast, promyelocyte, myelocyte,
metamyelocyte, band cell and finally polymorphonuclear neutrophil.

<na> Neutrophil responses require a fine balance:
underactivity leaves the body vulnerable to invasion, while over-activity is implicated in inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases, and cancer progression.

<na> Despite much interest in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying human neutrophil
behaviors, their use in experimental research is limited by their very short life-span. They begin to undergo
apoptosis within 6 to 12 hours after isolation [4], making techniques such as genetic perturbation
impractical.

<na> Important outstanding questions include to what degree the in vitro differentiated cells recapitulate
neutrophil gene expression, and what differences in gene expression exist that may affect particular
neutrophil behaviors.

<na> Finally, we organized our data, together with previously published
data, in a public neutrophil gene expression database that is searchable by gene name and by protein
domain content. This database will serve as a resource for the community for easy comparison of gene
expression in the cell lines versus human and mouse primary neutrophils, and as a reference for improving
gene perturbation strategies in neutrophil models.

<na> While our initial results indicated that DMSO is the most suitable agent for inducing neutrophil marker
expression without hampering cell viability, we wanted to explore variations of the protocol that might
further improve differentiation efficiency.

<q> What is summary statistics imputation used for?

<a> Summary statistics imputation can be used to impute association
summary statistics of an already conducted, genotype-based meta-analysis to higher
genomic resolution. This is typically needed when genotype imputation is not feasible.
Oftentimes, cohorts of such a meta-analysis are variable in terms of ancestry and
available sample size varies SNP-to-SNP. Both phenomena violate the assumption of
current methods that an external LD matrix and the covariance of the Z-statistics
are the same.

<na> To address these two issues, we present two extensions to the existing
summary statistics imputation method. Both extensions manipulate the LD matrix
needed for summary statistics imputation.

<na> Summary statistics imputation on the other hand starts off with association summary
statistics available for all genotyped markers and uses the same reference panel to infer directly
the association summary statistics of all SNVs available in the reference panel.

<na> Oftentimes a study or
a consortium has already provided association summary statistics imputed to an older reference
panel, in which case it is much faster to re-impute summary statistics to a newer panel without
going back to each study analyst and asking for genotype imputation and association analysis.

<a> To avoid violation of the assumptions (in particular
the instrument being exogenous) it is safer to consider other possible confounders to
test robustness of the causal effect estimation. To achieve this, summary statistics from a large
number of different studies need to be imputed to the same set of reference SNVs.

<na> Summary statistics imputation in the context of genomic data was first described by Wen and
Stephens (2010), where they inferred allele frequencies for an untyped SNV, by a linear combination
of observed allele frequencies.

<na> In this paper we present two improvements of the existing methods. First, we propose a method
that is able to optimally combine reference panels to best match the GWAS population. Next,
we extend the imputation formula to be able to accommodate variable sample size for SNVs
with available summary statistics.

<na> This manipulation of the covariance estimation can be
used to adapt the reference panel population structure towards the population structure that is
observed in GWAS summary statistics.

<na> For simulation of GWAS summary statistics we used data from the five European subpopulations
CEU, GBR, FIN, TSI and IBR of the 1KG (1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010). We chose
to up-sample chromosome 15 using HAPGEN2 (Su et al. 2011) to 5’000 individuals for each
subpopulation, yielding a total of 25’000 individuals.

<na> To assess our extended summary statistics imputation method we used upsampled datasets,
yielding 250000 European individuals in total. GWASs were simulated using in silico phenotypes.
This semi-simulation framework allows us to study reference panel sizes up to 120500
(half of each sub-population) as well as the impact of reference panel composition.

<q> What are the virulence factors of the pneumococcus?

<a> The polysaccharide capsule is the main virulence factor of the pneumococcus: nearly 100 distinct
capsular antigenic types (serotypes) have been described and certain serotypes are predominantly
associated with disease whilst others are largely associated with nasopharyngeal colonisation.

<na> Streptococcus pneumoniae (the ‘pneumococcus’) is a frequent coloniser of the human nasopharynx
and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding the composition and
dynamics of the pneumococcal population is crucial, as these factors influence the observed
distribution of disease in the human population.

<na> The pneumococcus is most commonly an asymptomatic coloniser of the nasopharynx in healthy young
children; however, colonisation is also the initial stage of the disease process. Pneumococci are among
the most common causes of otitis media, sinusitis and conjunctivitis, and a leading cause of severe
infections such as pneumonia, bacteraemia and meningitis.

<na> We identified several
clusters belonging to the lactococcin 972, sactipeptide and lassopeptide classes of bacteriocins,
which were hitherto not known to be harboured by the pneumococcus (Table 1; Supplementary
Table 1).

<na> BLAST searches of the NCBI database of non-redundant nucleotide sequences revealed that the
majority of these clusters were not exclusive to pneumococcus, but that identical or similar versions
were present in other streptococci (Supplementary Table 2). Therefore, we used the prefix “strepto”
and named each cluster according to its class of bacteriocin (see Methods).

<na> This is
fundamental, as it provides the framework on which to investigate the mechanisms underpinning
specific bacteriocin-pneumococcus combinations and the activity of specific bacteriocin and
immunity genes.

<na> Here, we revealed that the pneumococcus possesses a substantially greater and more varied array of
bacteriocins than previously recognised. Using a large global and historical pneumococcal genome
dataset, we determined the prevalence, co-occurrence patterns and molecular epidemiology of all
the identified bacteriocin clusters within a collection of pneumococci recovered over the past 90
years.

<na> Bacteriocin production has been associated with more
efficient colonisation of a host by the producer strain, owing to the ability of these toxins to remove
competitors.

<na> Moreover, there is obvious potential for the development of bacteriocins
as novel antimicrobials and our study presents many new opportunities for drug development. At a
time when the challenges of antimicrobial-resistant microbes have never been more acute, these
data provide many new areas of investigation.

<na> ). Pneumococci were grown in brain-heart infusion broth for 6
hours and RNA extractions were performed on samples from five time points (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 hours
of incubation) using the Promega Maxwell® 16 Instrument and LEV simplyRNA Cells purification kit,
following the manufacturer’s protocol.

<q> Why obtaining high quality plant genomes is more difficult than the human?

<a> However, plant genomes can be much more repetitive and larger
than human, and plant biology makes obtaining high quality DNA free from contaminants difficult. Reflecting their
challenging nature we observe that plant genome assembly statistics are typically poorer than for vertebrates.

<a> However, the human genome is not representative of all eukaryotic
genomes; plant genomes in particular are typically more
repetitive (including multi-kilobase long retrotransposon elements
as well as even longer regions comprising of “nested” transposon
insertions). Plant biology also poses challenges for the isolation of
high quality high molecular weight DNA, due to strong cell walls,
co-purifying polysaccharides, and secondary metabolites which
inhibit enzymes or directly damage DNA [13]. Thus technologies
that work well on vertebrate genomes may not work well for plants
[18].

<na> This is especially noticeable in a plant genome with
higher repeat content, and is one of the major reasons for breaks
in contiguity in these assemblies.

<na> We see how plant biology
poses some additional challenges for the isolation of high quality
high molecular weight DNA. The genome size of about 722 Mbp
is suitable for testing many different technologies whilst keeping
the costs reasonable.

<na> The careful choice of organism
where possible, such as a highly inbred plant or doubled haploid,
can remove the problems caused by structural heterozygosity. This
approach was adopted for the potato DM reference, whereby a
completely homozygous “doubled monoploid” was used instead of
a highly heterozygous potato genotype.

<na> Developments in high-throughput sequencing have revolutionised
genetics and genomics, with lower costs leading to an explosion
in genome sequencing project size [1]. This diversity of
sequencing and assembly methods, coupled to the activities of
many laboratories, are generating multiple assemblies.

<na> The human genome has
now been sequenced and assembled using various technologies
including Sanger, 454, IonTorrent, Illumina, Pacific Biosciences
(PacBio), 10x Genomics and even nanopore sequencing technologies
[25, 31, 6, 37, 46, 17].

<na> Thus technologies
that work well on vertebrate genomes may not work well for plants
[18]. For these reasons slow and expensive clone based minimal
tiling path sequencing approaches have persisted in plants [9, 30]
long after faster, cheaper short read whole genome assemblies
were first demonstrated for vertebrate genomes [26].

<na> Using the genome of S. verrucosum we are
able to demonstrate that repeat content does limit the contiguity of
the assembly by comparing the assembly to BAC sequences, and
find out which technology can resolve large repeats.

<na> Our results can be used as guidance for further sequencing
assembly projects and provide a basis for comparative genome
studies, as each sequencing strategy and assembly method has its
own biases.

<q> How reads were mapped to genome?

<a> Illumina output reads were processed as described in (Paul et al., 2017). The reads were
mapped to SK1 genome (Yue et al., 2017) using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). Only reads
that mapped to a single position and also matched perfectly to the SK1 genome were retrieved
for further analysis.

<na> Because DSBs are potentially genotoxic, a number of processes choreograph DSB formation at
the right place and time to maintain genome integrity (Cooper et al., 2016; de Massy, 2013;
Gray and Cohen, 2016; Lam and Keeney, 2014; Subramanian and Hochwagen, 2014; Yu et al.,
2016).

<na> To assay enrichment at the rDNA borders, TARs (120 Kb from either telomere)
were excluded from the genome to obtain the random bootstrap-derived distribution.

<na> The processed dataset
aligned to S288c reference genome (sacCer2) was used. The mapped Spo11-oligo counts for
wild type and zip3∆ mutant, GEO number GSE48299, aligned to the S288c reference genome
(sacCer2) were obtained from (Thacker et al., 2014).

<na> Southern analysis of ndt80Δ cells undergoing a
synchronous meiotic time course revealed new examples of short-lived (YER004W, YER024W,
YOR001W) and long-lived hotspots (YIL081W, YFL021W) (Figure 1A, data not shown),
indicating that both hotspot classes are common in the yeast genome.

<na> To extend this analysis across the genome, we assessed markers of DSB formation by ChIPseq
assay. Histone H2A phosphorylated on serine 129 (pH2A) is a well-documented chromatin
modification that is activated by DSB formation and spreads into an approximately 50 Kb region
around DNA breaks (Shroff et al., 2004; Unal et al., 2004).

<na> In both wild type and ndt80Δ mutants, the increase
in Hop1 enrichment was above 95% CI for a bootstrap-derived distribution of enrichment along
the genome (Figure 2C). These data suggest that continued DSB formation in the TARs is the
result of persistent Hop1 enrichment in these domains.

<na> In the context of the yeast genome, TARs are unusually large functional regions, spanning
nearly 100kb, which corresponds to almost half of the smallest yeast chromosome. Although the
highly consistent positioning of TARs implies a role for telomeres in setting up this architecture,
it is unclear how such long-range effects could be established.

<na> The
ChIP libraries were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 500 instruments at NYU
Biology Genomics core to yield 50 bp single-end reads.

<na> Moreover, an ancient telomeric fusion that gave rise to human chromosome 2 led to a decrease
in crossovers rates near the fused chromosome ends compared to chimpanzees, which
maintained the two separate chromosomes (Auton et al., 2012). Thus, some fundamental
features of TARs may well be evolutionarily conserved.

<q> What is ribosome footprint?

<a> With the advent of high-throughput methods to measure translation elongation in vivo, we can
understand the functional implications of codon usage. Ribosome profiling measures translation
transcriptome-wide by capturing and sequencing the regions of mRNA protected within ribosomes, called
ribosome footprints.

<na> Expanded probabilistic
and neural network models have shown that the sequence context of a ribosome contributes to its
elongation rate, both directly and through higher order features such as nascent protein sequence.
Computational modeling has also indicated that technical artifacts and biases contribute to the
distribution of ribosome footprints.

<na> Expanding the sequence context around the A site steadily improved the predictive
performance, up to the full span of a ribosome footprint (-5 to +4; MSE = 0.66). Additional sequence
context beyond the boundaries of the ribosome did not affect performance.

<na> Performance improved
upon including structure scores at nucleotide positions -17, -16, and -15, i.e., the windows that span the
actual ribosome footprint (Fig. 1C, Supp. Fig. 1). No individual windows downstream of the footprint
improved our predictions, nor did the maximum structure score over 30 sliding windows downstream of
the ribosome (Fig. 1C).

<na> We also observed strong sequence preferences at the 3´ end of ribosome footprints. Sequence bias has
previously been noted in the 5´ and 3´ ends of ribosome footprints, and this has been suggested to arise
from ligase preferences during library preparation.

<na> These experiments, like our own, made use of CircLigase enzymes to
circularize ribosome footprints after reverse transcription. In contrast, the experiment we first modeled
used T4 RNA ligase to attach 5´ linkers directly onto ribosome footprint fragments.

<na> . The
least-favored sequences were ligated by CircLigase II with only 20% the efficiency of the most-favored
sequences, meaning that some ribosome footprints would be represented at five times the frequency of
other footprints for purely technical reasons.

<na> Synonymous​ ​codon​ ​choice​ ​can​ ​have​ ​dramatic​ ​effects​ ​on​ ​ribosome​ ​speed,​ ​RNA​ ​stability,​ ​and
protein​ ​expression.​ ​Ribosome​ ​profiling​ ​experiments​ ​have​ ​underscored​ ​that​ ​ribosomes​ ​do
not​ ​move​ ​uniformly​ ​along​ ​mRNAs,​ ​exposing​ ​a​ ​need​ ​for​ ​models​ ​of​ ​coding​ ​sequences​ ​that
capture​ ​the​ ​full​ ​range​ ​of​ ​empirically​ ​observed​ ​variation.

<na> As the ribosome moves along a transcript, it encounters diverse codons, tRNAs, and amino acids. This
diversity affects translation elongation and, ultimately, gene expression. For instance, exogenous gene
expression can be seriously hampered by a mismatch between the choice of synonymous codons and the
availability of tRNAs.

<na> Here, we have used neural networks to model ribosome
distribution along transcripts. The model captured biological variation in translation elongation speed
and also quantified technical biases affecting footprint count, which we confirmed experimentally.

<q> How identify tandem repeats (TRs) in genome?

<a> We used the whole genome sequence of Bombus terrestris as a reference in which
we identified TRs in the bumblebee genome using Tandem Repeats Finder. After
redundancy elimination (see Methods), a total of 26,595 TRs were identified.

<na> Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly dynamic regions of the genome. Mutations
occurred at these loci represent a significant source of genetic variation. Bumblebees
are important pollinating insects occupying a wide range of habitats.

<na> Because
they are known to be highly variable, TRs are also known as VNTRs (variable
number of tandem repeats). A number of cellular processes (for example, replication,
recombination, DNA damage repair, and other aspects of DNA metabolism) and
external factors are known to cause mutations in TRs, thus the frequency of mutations
at these loci is thought to be 100 to 10,000 times higher than point mutations.

<na> Tandem repeats in promoters change gene
expression in yeast, and contribute to gene expression variation in humans.
Therefore, given that TRs are highly mutable regions in the genome and therefore
represent a significant source of variation, in cases where this variation is at loci
influencing morphological, physiological and behavioral traits, it could facilitate the
adaptation of the organism to different environments.

<na> Tandem repeats (TRs) are ubiquitous in the genomes of diverse species, where they
represent highly dynamic regions of mutation and can thus facilitate the evolution of
coding and regulatory sequences.

<a> Each of the 18 chromosome sequences of B. terrestris was uploaded to Tandem
Repeats Database (TRDB)45. First, the sequence of each chromosome was analyzed
using Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) using default parameters : 2, 7, 7, 50 (match,
mismatch, indels, minimal alignment score)30. Then, TRs with repeat unit length less
than 2 or array length less than 30 bp were discarded. Finally, redundant TRs reported
for the same loci were excluded using the Redundancy Elimination tool at TRDB.

<na> We identified 26,595 TRs in the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) genome,
66.7% of which reside in genic regions. We also compared TRs found in B. terrestris
with those present in the whole genome sequence of a congener, B. impatiens.

<na> In the present study, we performed a systematic examination of TRs in the bumblebee
genome and investigate their contribution to genetic variation in bumblebees. We
further examine the functional significance of the genetic variation introduced by TRs
to bumblebee genes.

<na> Considering the estimated genome size of B. terrestris is 249 Mb, the average
density of TRs in B. terrestris is 106 TRs/Mb.

<na> The distribution of repeat unit lengths of TRs in the bumblebee genome is
summarized in Fig. 1A. In general, the number of TR loci decrease with increasing
repeat unit length.

<q> Is hand grip strength heritable?

<a> Hand grip strength, a simple indicator of muscular strength, has been
associated with a range of health conditions, including fractures, disability,
cardiovascular disease and premature death risk. Twin studies have suggested a high
(50-60%) heritability, but genetic determinants are largely unknown.

<na> Twin studies have suggested a high
(50-60%) heritability, but genetic determinants are largely unknown.

<na> In our discovery analysis of 223,315 individuals, we identified
101 loci associated with grip strength at genome-wide significance (P<5×10-8). Of
these, 64 were associated (P<0.01 and consistent direction) also in the replication
dataset (N=111,610).

<na> In this study, our aim was to study genetic variation associated with muscular
strength in a large sample of 334,925 individuals of European descent from the UK
Biobank, and to evaluate shared genetic aetiology with and causal effects of grip
strength on physical and cognitive health.

<na> Further, we demonstrated a significant enrichment
of gene expression in brain-related transcripts among grip strength associations.

<na> Finally, we observed inverse genetic correlations of grip strength with
cardiometabolic traits, and positive correlation with parents’ age of death and
education; and showed that grip strength was causally related to fitness, physical
activity and other indicators of frailty, including cognitive performance scores.

<na> In our study of over 330,000 individuals from the general population,
the genetic findings for hand grip strength suggest an important role of the central
nervous system in strength performance. Further, our results indicate that maintaining
good muscular strength is important for physical and cognitive performance and
healthy aging.

<a> In this largest GWAS to date for grip strength, we report 64 loci robustly associated
with grip strength. Many of the lead SNPs were located in or near genes known to
have a function in developmental disorders, and one of the most significant genes
based on gene-based analysis (ATP2A1) encodes SERCA1, the critical enzyme in
calcium uptake to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which plays a major role in muscle
contraction and relaxation.

<na> Our results allow us to draw several conclusions. First, it is well known that muscular
strength depends not only on the quantity of the involved muscles, but also on the
ability of the nervous system to appropriately recruit the muscle cells. Thus, this is
concordant with our results showing the brain as the most important organ regulating
muscular strength.

<na> In conclusion, we identified a large number of genetic loci associated with hand grip
strength providing insights of biological processes involved in individual variation in
muscular strength and providing clues for discovery of new treatments for musclerelated
diseases.
